Why does your idea matter: How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet, or make the internet more awesome? \*
The core principles of the Internet are openness and communication. We see VR as the basis for a new frontier of communication products, Social VR platforms. Hastened by the closure and general failings of the once-open source High Fidelity platform, we are now in desperate need of open source alternatives to the growing number of closed source VR-compatible walled gardens in development.

We are at the pinnacle of a new wave of VR and related tech, and with the impending maturity of open game engines, audio and video codecs, combined with faster internet connectivity capable of hosting services, and increasingly available VR hardware, the time is right to lead the development of an open platform.

We believe in putting power back in the hands of individuals, and thus we are strong believers in decentralized technology. Our initial goal will be to produce a polished, well-functioning service, but we also have plans to integrate decentralized authentication and encryption schemes, including GPG and web of trust based E2EE, as well as decentralized content distribution tech such as Bittorrent and IPFS.

Who are your users or potential users?

We are building a product for all users of social VR, online collaboration or communication products. Social VR is a growing space, and its potential is only beginning to be realized, with a mass movement towards virtual collaboration.

Even VR as a whole is still in very early stages, but it represents a large potential market, especially with the recent availability of affordable and easy to install headsets such as the Oculus Quest, which has seen rapid growth after its release one year ago.

An example of a leading VR platform with public numbers, VRChat has recently between 12000 and 15000 concurrent online users across VR and Desktop platforms, with roughly 4000 concurrent VR users using this platform (out of a reported 4 million registered users as of 2019).

What is your personal connection to the service & the user group you are planning to reach with your product? \*

We're a passionate team of VR enthusiasts, some of us tinkering in our spare time with visual effects, level design, or graphics concepts still in research.

In an age where collaborating and connecting at distance is increasingly important, meeting in real life can often be a barrier to people. VR has the potential to bring people together and immerse them in a shared space, in a way that not even the best video collaboration can. I and another member of our group have participated in Virtual Market 4, the most recent iteration of a Japanese-run exponentially-growing marketplace of virtual content spanning multiple platforms.

Other Social VR platforms have found ways to immerse me in a multitude of realities: for example, engaging in real time with people around the world at all times of day and night: attending live dance and music events, seeing performers breakdance and do pole acrobatics using VIVE full body trackers, forming friendships through exchanging personal stories around a campfire, programming environments defined by a math function and then experiencing them in VR, even solving a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle with friends. It is my dream to enable these experiences and more in a setting that is sustainable, open and accessible.

If we do not fund this project, will your team still work on it? To what extent? \*

An Injection of capital by Mozilla will speed up our development and let me take leave of my company to focus full time on the MVP. This could give us the opportunity to outrun these walled gardens in a very short time.

If not funded, we will be able to continue to advance it more slowly in our spare time, but other closed platforms are catching up, and time is of the essence. Our project will additionally drive development around open source VR support and 3D tools, and we can see lasting effects from our contributions in those areas.

Why did you pick this idea? Do you have domain expertise? How do you know people need what you’re building? \*

We’re seeding the beginning of the VR frontier, and we already see a sizable fraction of the current VR population spending a substantial amount of time in Social VR walled gardens, such as VRChat.

It can be difficult or impossible to build atop walled garden platforms outside of their respective visions: we’ve run into such roadblocks in past projects. For example a combination of lack of the persistence, access to media/web requests, and general customizability has made other platforms unsuitable for building long games, and unsuitable for building complex collaboration tools. Meanwhile, our platform can be self hosted, allows private usage and can be modified.

Our team includes significant backend and operations experience and several years of work on Godot Engine, all of which will be relevant to building this platform.

We suspect the need exists for an open alternative to other competing walled gardens. While many VR platforms are currently free-to-use and advertise a minimal set of privacy features, there is no guarantee that popular platforms will remain free or private forever: for example, a widely used product could be acquired by a corporation with different goals.

Additionally, we see potential for a customizable, open platform to be used within enterprises, as well as to build the foundation for games or other content which share needs with our platform, such as its VOIP or VR interaction features.

Describe your work plan.

**THIS IS A COPY OF OUR GANTT CHART. THIS WAS NOT SUBMITTED ~Lyuma**

Week 1:
Maintain continuous integration of Windows SteamVR and Oculus Quest, and Linux server builds running on a public server against which to test and dogfood the product.
VOIP implementation: basic lipsync based on volume, integrate spatialization library.
Improve Inverse Kinematics implementation and add non-VR support.

Week 2:
Headless clients to extensively stress test the system.
Implement crash reporting system, and reporting metrics including performance.
Content: Use a basic scripting API to implement physics based games.
Begin work on engine changes necessary to give smooth framerates even when during content loading.

Week 3:
Networking interpolation: eliminate stuttering caused by networking.
Godot OpenVR Plugin: fix bugs causing inconsistent framerate in VR.
Pre-load content where needed to avoid stutters in the 3d environment.

Week 4:
Content: Begin work on specific set of hardcoded avatars.
Content: Recruit artist to begin work on create default home map.
Physics: fix physics errors such as sliding down ramps.
Test performance on regular vr hardware and optimization.

Week 5-6:
Account system, TOS, Privacy Policy.
Allow closed registration of users, starting with people who have already shown interest.
Continue working on content. Fix bugs and issues as needed.
Integration of video playback.
Focus on stress testing.

Week 7-8
Fix bugs discovered during testing.
Monitor performance metrics captured by users, keep fixing performance

Describe the approach the team will take to develop the Minimum Viable Product throughout the summer. This includes, but not limited to:

- _Who are your competitors?_

VRChat, Facebook Horizon, RecRoom, AltSpace, EngageVR, Spatial (quest), Mozilla Hubs, VirtualCast, cluster, Sansar, HTC Vive Sync, OasisVR, ChilloutVR, Lavender, Roblox VR
(We are not considering non-VR capable platforms or MMORPGs as competition)

- _How will you attract your first 1000 users? Your first 1,000,000?_

We anticipate contacts from our immediate VR communities who have already shown interest in our project will seed the first 50 users.

At a minimum, we will provide the real time presence features available in other VR platforms: appearing in a room of people who you can hear and to break past 100 users, we will need to provide experiences which are not easily accessible on other platforms such as VRChat.

To move beyond thousands of users: being a neutral, open platform to host events: for example, Virtual Market had on the order of a million visitors ( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLX7UNKV1fk> ; <https://v-market.work/> ), was hosted just as a collection of VRChat world instances, and still had to deal with several glitches as a result of instabilities of the underlying platform.

Another source of usage will be business meetings, and anything where privacy and self-hosting is a concern. Making sure that it is lightweight and remains very easy to compile will allow novel usages and customizations of the platform.

What challenges do you anticipate with this idea?

With the exception of Hubs, the now-defunct High Fidelity, and a handful of proprietary VR platforms, most Social VR applications are being developed in Unity. This leads to a design challenge in building around infrastructure and content that was created specifically with Unity in mind. For example, one of the leading open model sharing formats VRM only officially supports exporting from Unity.

Social platforms are strongly impacted by network effect, which puts a challenge towards acquisition. On top of this, VR applications tend to have extremely low retention compared with conventional applications. One possible reason is the restriction of only running one application at a time.

We are likely to encounter several unanticipated engineering challenges: VR platforms combine most of the hardest problems in all aspects of computing, from art, networking, social features to graphics optimization.
