Split the monolithic animation player.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Move the animations on to different subbranches.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Can be an addon

### Positive Consequences
