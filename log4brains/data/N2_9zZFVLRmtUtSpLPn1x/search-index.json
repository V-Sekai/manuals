In the Animation section, enable the following options\n    - [x] Scale FPS\n    - [x] Scene Duration\n- use the Pose Transfer tab (vertical tab part of the \"N\" options panel?)\n    - Source: the imported BVH armature\n    - Target: the imported avatar armature\n    - Click the Rebuild Bone List\n        - manually map over any bones not automatically mapped\n        - eg: LeftLowerArm => \"Left elbow\"\n        - note: it is possible to save your mapping to .json and reuse\n    - Click Retarget Animation\n        - retargeting may take several minutes\n- verify retargeting by playing the animation via the Blender play button\n- Export the scene as a .glb (using default settings)\n\n### Common Problems\n\nQ: retargeted animation seems to have legs crossed / backwards\n\nA: This can happen if you import a VRM avatar as a .gltf (re-import using the VRM importer add-on)\n\nQ: legs/arms bend unnaturally \n\nA: check the armature bone name mappings\n  - at most, each target bone name should appear once\n  - leave BVH joints not present in your avatar blank\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n**Thanks to humbletim for being the scribe**\n\n**Thanks to lyuma for being test pilot flying these steps**\n\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Have a generally robust process of retargeting motions to VRM-type models.\n\n### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Only VRM\n- MMD does not work.\n\n## Option graveyard: Adobe Mixamo\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Propietary Online Service\n* Blackbox technology\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nMotion retargeting is not trivial offline or online.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need motions for our character controller without using an off-the-shelf black box solution.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://www.blender.org/\n- https://hackmd.io/EmOAt375S8KFqaNdPDJCXQ\n"}],["20210523-complete-gltf2-vrm-import-and-export-pipeline-in-godot-engine",{"title":"Complete glTF2 / VRM import and export pipeline in Godot Engine","verbatim":"\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe are unable to import characters in animations and unable to export them.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nVRM and glTF import allows us to bring models in and export allows us to get the models out.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nTo be determined.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Character import supports\n- World export support\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Technical debt\n\n(this section can be repeated for each option, if more than one option is open for consideration\n\n## Option graveyard: USDZ\n\nList the proposed options no longer open for consideration.\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Requires GDNative \n* Complicated\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nPossible to be gdscript\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need to provide trust for the toolchains.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- <AdrLink slug=\"20210523-complete-gltf2-vrm-import-and-export-pipeline-in-godot-engine\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Complete glTF2 / VRM import and export pipeline in Godot Engine\" customLabel=\"Notary Trust\" />"}],["20210523-distribute-trusted-clients-with-notary",{"title":"Distribute trusted clients with notary","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe use itch.io distribute our software clients.\n\n1.
