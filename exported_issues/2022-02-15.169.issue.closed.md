Problem: I wish to use cloth of ~100's of vertices on every character in the scene.
- Performance (editor) = not storing NodePath per vertex
- Creator flexibility
- Performance (runtime) = not colliding against the entire physics scene

- use Skeleton instead of NodePath to avoid crashing on over hundreds of vertices
- possibly allow vertices to be weight painted to multiple bones (to connect seamlessly with part of the model that are not cloth)
- use an alternate physics system for simulation, for example whitelist the set of colliders which interact with the cloth, similar to springbones (performance)

Ideally we would be able to share code with SoftBody, but this is not a given.

Needs to be tracked as a Godot Engine proposal / pr.
