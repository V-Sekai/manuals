# Draft: Bake alembic imports by running blender script

### Context and Problem Statement

Want to bake alembic imports to gltf blend shapes.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We run a python script in Blender to bake alembic inputs to gltf2.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

```python
# MIT LICENSE
# Authored by iFire#6518 and alexfreyre#1663
# This code ONLY apply to a mesh and simulations with ONLY the same vertex number

import bpy

#Converts a MeshCache or Cloth modifiers to ShapeKeys
frame = bpy.context.scene.frame_start
for frame in range(bpy.context.scene.frame_end + 1):
    bpy.context.scene.frame_current = frame

    # For alembic files converted to MDD and loaded as MeshCache.
    bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply_as_shapekey(keep_modifier=True, modifier="MeshCache")

    # For cloth simulations inside blender using a Cloth modifier.
    #bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply_as_shapekey(keep_modifier=True, modifier="Cloth")

# Loop through shapekeys and add as keyframe per frame.
# https://blender.stackexchange.com/q/149045/87258
frame = bpy.context.scene.frame_start
for frame in range(bpy.context.scene.frame_end + 1):
    bpy.context.scene.frame_current = frame

    for shapekey in bpy.data.shape_keys:
        for i, keyblock in enumerate(shapekey.key_blocks):
            if keyblock.name != "Basis":
                curr = i - 1
                if curr != frame:
                    keyblock.value = 0
                    keyblock.keyframe_insert("value", frame=frame)
                else:
                    keyblock.value = 1
                    keyblock.keyframe_insert("value", frame=frame)

# bpy.ops.object.modifier_remove(modifier="MeshCache")
# bpy.ops.object.modifier_remove(modifier="Cloth")
```

Do not use the pc2 vertex cache format because of mesh accuracy loss.

### Positive Consequences

Can convert alembic to gltf2 for better interoperability.

### Negative Consequences

Blend shapes are big.

### Option graveyard

Option: Don't convert.

This loses the animation.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We already made a solution.
