## What is the context of the proposal?

A shift from Kubernetes to Dokku is proposed to reduce complexity and operating costs.

## What is the problem being solved?

Kubernetes provides more overhead than necessary, leading to higher expenses and maintenance challenges.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Deploy services using Dokku plugins and minimal containers.
1. Deploy Uro service for the Elixir application server.
1. ~~Deploy S3 compatible storage solution within Dokku like SeaweedFS. Minio is not license-compatible.~~ Aspirational.
1. Example code:

   ```bash
   # Install the PostgreSQL plugin
   # Alternative - deploy using oxide's fork of Cockroachdb. [oxidecomputer/cockroach](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/cockroach). 
   dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git postgres

   # Create a database instance
   dokku postgres:create my-database

   # Deploy Elixir app
   git push dokku master
   ```

1. Use Caddy for SSL and Tailscale for network access.
