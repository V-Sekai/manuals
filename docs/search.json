In particular, the dynamic_shapes and simple_embedding samples showcase how to run on your choice of target. The input program may have a signature in the stablehlo dialect, and you can use IREE or XLA depending on your preferred tech stack or runtime requirements. The Vulkan stack in IREE is relatively stable and offers good performance, with nod.ai’s SHARK offering extra tuning and APIs on top. However, there may be differences in optimization depending on the workload and potential driver bugs and pitfalls.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nProvide IREE to godot engine.\nUses the Vulkan back end.\n\ninput_count\ninput/0/data (TypedArray)\noutput_count\noutput/0/data (TypedArray)\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nHave a playground for testing.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDon’t use onnx because it doesn’t have vulkan support which limits reach.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a small number of gdscript lines.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nI know how, and no one else is doing it.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nSHARK\nIREE in-tree samples: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples\nIREE extra/more complex samples: https://github.com/iree-org/iree-samples\nIREE dynamic shapes sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/dynamic_shapes\nIREE CPU/Vulkan/CUDA sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/simple_embedding\nXLA axpy example: https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/examples/axpy\nnod.ai SHARK: https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK\nnod.ai SHARK results on AMD GPUs using Vulkan: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/"

    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,Lyuma,SaracenOne\n\n\n\nFor Groups, this system aims to solve the following issues:\n\n(A) Need a way to standardize scene spawning.\n(B) Need a way to refer to nodes/instances that is consistent across clients (for example, “Set parent to …”).\n(C) Need a way to synchronize state between clients.\n(D) Provides a basic set of standard protocols and interactions.\n(E) Provides the basis for a security/privacy model regarding entity communication/permissions over the network.\n(F) Provides a security model locally for access between nodes of one entity and nodes of another entity (assuming a secure scripting framework is implemented).\n(G) This also solves the problem of abstracting away implementation details of entities; for example, there should be no need to deal with Godot nodes on an individual basis.\n(H) Provide a unified way to create top-level physics hierarchies isolated from other game logic.\n\nNote: This proposal covers three Spawn Types:\n\nSpawn type (i) Entities integrated into a map;\nSpawn type (ii) map entities spawned by clients; and\nSpawn type (iii) avatar entities/props spawned by clients.)\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of:\n\nvehicle games\nbow and arrow games\npickup of balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n\n\nAldridge, David. “I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach”.

What do you mean?\nThe script_language.h includes packet_peer.h, so PacketPeer cannot use GDVIRTUAL because that needs script_language.h\n\nQuestions\nHow do modern games different games have different bandwidth minimums?\nCents per hour to host how many players?\nHole-punching for pure peer-to-peer games.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is compiled into the project and is work to change.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nNetworking is part of the project and can’t be changed by mods.\n\n\nReferences\nNo response\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nAvatars are a strength of V-Sekai.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nCode complexity.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nReduz isn’t interested in OIT.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/master/doc/TressFX4xDeveloperGuide.pdf\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXPPLL.hlsl\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXShortCut.hlsl\nhttps://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html\nhttps://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/oit/oit.cpp\n\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete!

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml"

Vargrant is not the status quo.\n\nProxying\nSome udp based proxying methods are known\n\nhttps://github.com/yyyar/gobetween for standalone\ncillium for kubernetes\nWebRTC ice, stun, turn\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nV-Sekai Developers\nWe package V-Sekai in Soiree party mode.\n\nWe start a single server of CockroachDB SQL database and not the default 3 server mode.\nWe provide installs of the Godot game engine client and server.\nWe re-arrange our elixir application Uro to work as a Sandstorm.io application.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai Packages\n\nV-Sekai provides a Server Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Client Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Uro Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\n\nThere is an open question if V-Sekai sandbox design works with powerbox.\n\n\nPlayer and Hosts\n\nIndividual hosts of Sandstorm.io can start their own grains of V-Sekai in Soiree mode.\nPlayers download the Godot Engine client and play.\n\n\n\nHosts\n\nMust provide a way to access the Godot Engine server and the Sandstorm server.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt is not trivial and not a few lines to implement a distributed system for a developer.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nSelf-hosted is a feature.\nWe can use Soiree Party mode to test V-Sekai.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nMaybe too complicated for the developers.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are investigating how to implement the Soiree Party mode.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/powerbox/\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/services/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm\nhttps://github.com/mrmetaverse/soiree\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users’ input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; D(Combine Variations)\n  B --&gt; E(Base Model)\n  C --&gt; F(Shape Variation)\n  C --&gt; G(Color Variation)\n  C --&gt; H(Texture Variation)\n  F --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  G --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  H --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  E --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  I --&gt; J(Final Output)\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\nUser Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\nSelect Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\nApply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\nCombine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\nGenerate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user’s preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform’s appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEnhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\nUser personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\nEfficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nComplexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\nPerformance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDo nothing.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Status: draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Malek, Lyuma, SaracenOne, Fire,\nTags: Networking,\n\n\n\nWe seek to solve these issues:\n\n(A) Use godot 4.0’s networking tools.\n(B) Use a relay server that doesn’t run any game code, rather than a headless V-Sekai server.\n(C) Make the costs of hosting V-Sekai as small as possible.\n(D) Write the server in Rust, for the speed and safety guarantees.\n(E) Make networking highly scalable for a single server.\n(F) Allow a client to connect to multiple servers simultaneously without issues, for seamless travel and portals.\n(G) Synchronize state between clients\n\nNote: This proposal does not cover Permissions, and is based in part on the previous Entity Networking proposal.\n\n\n\nBy using the technologies described below, we will cover A-G.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce complexity, latency, and processing power, we have created a simple Mastership/Ownership model.\nClients are defined as individuals connecting to a Server, they have their own v-sekai game instance running.\nThe Relay Server, as of now, does not contain information about the state of the world, the only information the Relay Server contains is on Mastership/Ownership rules.\nP1 connects to the Server.\n\nP2 connects to the Server.\n\nP3 connects to the Server.\n\nP1 spawns in a Ball.\n\nServer marks that P1 has both Mastership and Ownership of Ball.\n\nServer synchronizes with P1 and sends the state of the Ball to P2, its location, rotation, the very fact of its existence, and its owner, master, and rule.\n\nServer State\n\n\n\nObjects\nMaster\nOwner\nRule\n\n\n\n\nBall\nP1\nP1\nAsk\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\nSince P1 is the Owner of the Ball, this means that P1 is the only one who can change the state of the ball. When Server synchronizes, if P2 were to have the ball in a different location then P1, the Server would tell P2 that the Ball is in the location P1 has it, and would do the same for P3. It can be thought of as a mutex on the state of the Ball. Whoever holds the Mutex is the one who can modify the state therein. This also means that all calculations for game state are split up among all the players, every player only has to run code modifying what they own, which in large scale player events would otherwise increase exponentially with custom scripts for each player’s props or avatars.\n\n\n\nThis presents a problem however, how could P2 take the Ball from P1? The solution is Mastership. Whoever is the Master can change who is the Owner at any time. The Master also can change whatever the default Rule is, which is what the Server, and Client references when looking to change Ownership to itself (or someone else?).\n\nAsk: Take a round trip to the Master and back to the Server so the Master can decide based on external factors whether or not to allow ownership transfer or deny it. This could be used for example, if someone only wants a gun to be grabbable if they are a “shooter” and not if they are a “civilian”\nDeny: You cannot ask for ownership transfer, good for things like Avatar’s transform node, you don’t wanna be involuntarily moved around, or for the root of the world map.\nAllow: You can ask for ownership any time, and it is automatically granted.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the rate of synchronization based on the closest clients owned model, and other things like that, there are a lot of areas for optimization when it comes to using this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Latency for Competitive/Real-Time interactions\nLow processing power on both the server and client side\nBroad enough to be easily modifiable for optimizations in the future without changing the model\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity, we will have to code this all from scratch basically\nMulti-user interactions become impossible on a single object, at least to do simply, some smart coding could get around it but it isn’t easy to do.\nResolutions for the allow rule could lead to inconsistencies, such as two different people picking up a gun and firing it, and two resulting bullets being spawned from the same gun before it gets removed from one individual.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely, this is the foundation of basically everything content wise in V-sekai.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/blob/master/decisions/2020/20200729-entity-networking.md\nMalek’s forum post on networking in the Discord server.\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.\nWhen switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.\nYou click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nAble to mask loading times\nAble to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai\nFor style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\ncoordinating cats\nThe drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.\nIt makes for a far less friction-less experience\nBut again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional\nWe could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWorld traversal is a problem.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

    "text": "VMD on VRM AnimationTree Node\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nEirexe made a VMD player based on Lox’s work.\nThis new ability means we now have a viable way to load VMD motions and use them as a VRM motion player.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe want to make an AnimationTree node to drive Miku Miku VMD motion and add other procedural animation features to blend motion on the VRM Avatar.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nHowever, we need to make some changes to the AnimationTree UI editor to make the changes possible. We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

    "text": "Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\nRight Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\nLeft Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\nRight Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.\nA line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nEasy Charts"

You will need Elixir installed.\nI recommend getting the latest, but for these steps, I am using Elixir v1.13.3.\nDownload Uro from https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nWe are using the dev environment. It is the default, but you can also set MIX_ENV=dev.\nTo compile HTML/CSS webpack:\ncd assets\nnpm install\nnpm run deploy\ncd ..\nIf the compile gives issues, you can run it multiple times. To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\nmix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The chief engineer’s prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.\nThe second mechanism is cross-functional communication. Every major feature requires at least an introduction so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThese aspects can be incompatible with current practices.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nKnowing what to do is hard.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nHow we develop the project is a core task.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nanother-look-at-how-toyota-integrates-product-development"

    "text": "Package Godot for pkgin\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nAccording to Netflix, the BSD-type operating systems are competitive, and supporting pkgsrc is an excellent way to start.\n\npkgsrc is a framework for managing third-party software on UNIX-like systems containing over 26,000 packages. It is the default package manager of NetBSD and SmartOS and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n\nV-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEffortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\nWider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\nPromoting cooperation: V-Sekai’s support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\nReinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai’s decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --&gt; B[Build and Package]\nB --&gt; C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --&gt; D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --&gt; E[macOS]\nD --&gt; F[Linux]\nD --&gt; G[NetBSD]\nC --&gt; H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --&gt; J[pkgin command]\nJ --&gt; H\nH --&gt; K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --&gt; I\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\nWide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\nEfficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\nUniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\nConnection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\nResource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai’s VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\nEmphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n\nOption graveyard\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform’s vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "We are looking to make complete documentation for the developers and users.\nWe have a list of features we need to cover already.\nWrite as efficiently as possible to immediately create all the draft pages, one for each significant feature or topic we need to cover. Every prominent feature requires at least an introduction, so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.\nOn each page, we want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a topic, for example, Godot XR. The user will need to know:\n\nWhat is XR (we can link to a page or briefly explain it)\nWhat is Godot (if we have covered it already on the previous page, link to that page, and briefly re-explain, e.g. in one sentence)\nHow XR works in Godot and how our product uses it\nWhat people can achieve concretely with that [feature/knowledge on this page]\nWhat are the limitations of the technology [that also affect our product]\n\nEach page’s draft should be a bullet list like this. Because then we or the writer instantly know all the points the page must cover And it doesn’t take very long to write and review those bullet lists\nLast, for all the cases where the user has to follow steps (for example, using an interface), we need to detail each step with the most straightforward words possible. For instance, if they need to click on three buttons, we describe the steps with explicit mentions of the labels as seen in the UI and always use the same verbs, for example:\n\n\n\nTo change the game’s resolution:\n\nOpen the Project -&gt; Project Settings… menu.\nIn the left column, navigate down to Display -&gt; Window. In the right part of the window, the game’s window settings appear.\nScroll down to the resolution setting.\nClick the numbers to change the resolution. The values are in pixels.\n\nWhen we say reusing the verbs, it’s about being consistent, like:\n\nClick a button\nOpen a menu\nOpen a file\nNavigate to a tab\n\nIt doesn’t have to be 100% of the time the same but for instance, for buttons, click and press are well understood, but “use,” while correct, may be a bit harder to parse\nAlso, changing the phrasing, style, and verbs used throughout our docs adds cognitive load.\nMaking things simple, explicit, and consistent allows users to focus on the steps and memorize new information.\n\n\n\nThis page was written with advice from gdquest."

    "text": "Moved issues into the tracker.\n\n\nWorked with manifold csg library author and was able to remove the boost dependency. https://github.com/elalish/manifold/pull/92\nAlso published a first draft on a Godot Engine master branch. See the issue for details.\n\n\n\nLyuma\nMade a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot’s node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.\nTo this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.\n(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)\nPushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.\nThis has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! @iFire\nMade some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else.\n\n\n\n\nRestore fix-save-as-binary so we can export projects\nRestore elixir shared branch so we can run godot in elixir\nPoked ludwig about diffusion net for machine learning training.\n\n\n\n\nFBX2GLTF and Blender importers are merged.\n\n\n\niFire\n\nMade a bug report for Blender exported animation to gltf with @RockyMadio https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1613 GitHub"

    "text": "Lyuma — 01/10/2022 I have pushed internal and external resource whitelisting at the ResrouceLoader (ResourceFormatLoaderBinary) level as a Godot engine patch.\n\nHere’s an example of what gets printed when the above script with OS.alert() attempts to be loaded\nERROR: user://asset_cache/81dd12d03686\n0a08faba06a1b47a3a29.scn:Resource of unrecognized type in file: GDScript.\n   at: load (core/io/resource_format_binary.cpp:789)\nERROR: Failed loading resource: user://asset_cache/81dd12d036860a08faba06a1b47a3a29.scn. Make sure resources have been imported by opening the project in the editor at least once.\nNote that I was forced to rebase to the latest build which includes the new build system (target=editor) most of the code I changed is in the private gitlab repo. once things stabilize and we get the build system up and running again, next step is to publish the remainder of the code on github\n\ngroups-4.x (and staging) were updated to latest. I attempted to update GoCD, but it’s a bit of a yolo merge, since a few pieces all had to be updated at once due to new scons target=editor argument we need to follow https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/ (log in as guest) and test the release builds\n\n\nexport builds are being created again with the new scons naming scheme. They seem to work on linux (steam deck) at least. Don’t have access to a windows machine right now\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/v-sekai/v-sekai-game is released as fully opensource.\n\n\n\n\niFire (he, him) — Today at 16:33 https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/pull/5 added caching to reduce doing nothing builds from 2 hours to 10 minutes ish\n\nNew contributors this week:\n@Malek Awesome for being around 🐱. Contributed to designs and cheering us when we succeed. Fixed the issue with the ci/cd with the recurse submodules. Too much to list!\n@gamethecupdog Helped us figured out some problems with AMD vr and V-sekai. We debugged the AMD VR launch issues and talked about fixing the vignette settings in the ui https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/378\n@meowses For supporting us and watching our presentation.\n@Kosyne For starting a topic about onboarding and our short term and long term planning.\n@! [P1-D3] Samuel Martin @Mr_Squarepeg Thanks for hanging out on Sunday, we chatted about V-Sekai and played a bit of ZeroK.\n\n\n\niFire (he, him) — Today at 12:34 Turned off the mesh mirror mode for avatars because of playtesting confusion.\nLyuma — Today at 13:04 makes sense. at some point we can add a mirror, and we need a map aligned at the right place, or a script added to maps which define where the ““mirrors”” are (there can be more than one since it’s just duplicating meshes which is cool)\niFire (he, him) — Today at 14:47 I added https://github.com/TokageItLab/realtime_retarget to V-Sekai’s godot engine c++ modules.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints?
