# Draft: Can Poly Green Coords extend to 3d?

Reminded by works by pixar: https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProfileMover/

How applicable is this to 3d polygonal cages?

    You may be interested by *[Green Coordinates for Triquad Cages in 3D](https://research.adobe.com/publication/green-coordinates-for-triquad-cages-in-3d/)* by Thiery and Boubekeur (SIGGRAPH Asia 2022). It is only for straight polygons though, the deformed cage cannot have Bézier arcs like this 2D version has, that's future work. ;) Profile curves are definitely a very nice and related work!
