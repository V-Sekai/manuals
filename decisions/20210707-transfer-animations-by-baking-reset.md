# Draft: Transfer animation by baking reset

## Context and Problem Statement

Given two animations `.glb`s in gltf, you cannot transfer the animation between the same character in different files in some cases.

Fixes: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/50212>

We are NOT retargeting between different rigs in the RESET baker stage.

We are NOT defining how to generate the RESET #animation in this proposal.

#### Problem extended

We want to transfer #animation between exact scenes with the same matching RESET animation.

We can import unlimited motion capture #animation to use if we can enforce a certain T-POSE and ensure the rigs are corresponding.

Multiple different specifications exist on bone rolls on specific bone names. If the skeleton matches one of them, we can use that set of rig animations.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We bake the RESET #animation and then set it to identity so that rigs with corresponding RESET #animation can have their #animation transferred.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

#### Bake RESET #animation

1. Import a new scene with animations.
1. A RESET #animation from the imported scene will automatically be baked to the skeleton.
1. Key all RESET #animation frames to identity.

#### Bake a specific frame

1. Pick an #animation frame time and click
2. First bake any existing RESET animation.
3. Bake the RESET #animation
4. Ensure that a RESET #animation track exists and is set to identity transform

#### RESET #animation Generators

1. Make a tool that can take a human character and make it T-pose (A-pose?) and then save it to the RESET animation.
1. Enforce bone rolls on the rig and then save it to the RESET animation.
1. Root motion centering (move to the origin) tool and then save it as the RESET animation.
1. Filter the RESET axes when baking per animation.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a confusing problem and hard to explain. So the code to solve it is non-obvious to propose and non-trivial to discover.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

# animation are a core feature of Godot Engine
