# Draft: Simplify Meshes and LODs better with Quads

## Context and Problem Statement

Better mesh simplification and LODs that work on quads.

Characters that use subdivision look much better and be a difference between 18,000 quads and millions of quads.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Research a way to do subdivsion and decimation on quads.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

To be determined.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Visual Quality
- Maintainability

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Technical complexity

(this section can be repeated for each option, if more than one option is open for consideration

## Option graveyard: Tris

List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.

List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial to do.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We want the source art to be in quads so we can post process it in the game.
