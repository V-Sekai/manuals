# Draft: Extended asset library packages in addition to the upstream asset library

### Context and Problem Statement

Have a way to deploy custom asset libs via the godot engine asset library ui

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We propose to use the V-Sekai uro server to provide an asset library url to Godot Engine.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Implement

1. rest passthrough <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-library/blob/master/API.md>
2. account based package bundles (does not include the original package, only the metadata)

### Positive Consequences

We can have our own asset archives.

### Negative Consequences

May compromise security.

### Option graveyard

Upload to the asset library directly.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain uro.
