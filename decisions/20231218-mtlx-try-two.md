# Draft: MaterialX try two

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The conversation revolves around the implementation of MaterialX in Blender nodes and its extension to glTF. The goal is to have an official KHR extension for MaterialX in glTF, which Blender should also support.

## The Challenge

This proposal discusses implementing MaterialX in Blender nodes and extending it to glTF. The aim is to support an official KHR extension for MaterialX in glTF.

## The Strategy

The plan is to first implement MaterialX in Blender nodes, then extend it to glTF. Once a KHR extension exists for MaterialX in glTF, Blender should add that.

## The Upside

If successful, this will allow for more efficient and effective use of MaterialX in Blender and its extensions. It will also pave the way for further developments and improvements in this area.

## The Downside

The downside is that this is a complex task that requires deep understanding and expertise in both Blender and MaterialX. There may also be unforeseen challenges and issues that could arise during the implementation process.

## The Road Not Taken

Success will enhance MaterialX use in Blender and its extensions. However, this complex task requires deep expertise in both Blender and MaterialX and may face unforeseen challenges.

## The Infrequent Use Case

An alternative could be focusing on MaterialX's functionality with OpenGL before its implementation in Blender nodes and glTF. Or using Material maker or Substance Designer.
