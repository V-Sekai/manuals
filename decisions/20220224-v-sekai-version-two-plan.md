## Context and Problem Statement

Know where we're going by describing what we want.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Proposed mission and a list of tasks.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

### To further the development of Godot and open source tech

- Godot Engine pull requests.

### To build a tech stack and service for interactive multiplayer VR games

1. One gitlab repo with source assets? (sky celebration and sponza).

- The ability to upload maps and avatars standalone via a SDK (set of submodules?) <https://github.com/V-Sekai/vsk_sdk>.
  - Being able to enter a vsk map âˆ€ maps (mvp = 1 map).
  - Enter a vsk map with an entity in it (upload sky celebration OR upload sponza with one beachball).
- VSK_map source asset repositories
- Lyuma will make a new github repo V-Sekai/vrm_submodule - we need a script for updating all submodules to the latest on a given branch.
- VSK_map source asset repositories
- I think vsk_sdk should only be submodules, no assets.
- We can git rebase -i to remove the binary assets from it.
- git merge to install the vsk_sdk into another project (such as gitlab). we need to look if git subtree supports .gitmodules and we can use it if it does.
- make vsk_sdk the head for all of the sdk related submodules. do our development there and commit submodules regularly.
- In groups project, pretend we delete all submodules in vsk_sdk. Then git merge vsk_sdk/main to bring in the submodules from that repo.
- Every time we update vsk_sdk, do a git merge into groups and our source asset repo with sponza etc.
- VSK_map source asset repositories
  - Don't save .scn assets in git.
    - no GLB.
    - blend files ~10MB ok. > 100MB let's either use GitLab LFS or something else.
    - Evaluate <https://dvc.org/>

2. Being able to have our group of people join and communicate. (godot speech).

- Porting C++ was discussed as a way forward to make it easier to debug

4. VR support (openxr).
5. Interacting with objects in desktop mode is important so that we can test easier.
6. Interacting with objects in vr.
7. Scripting (wasgo).
8. Network server to support 1000.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

Gain clarity of mission.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- The cost of overhead.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Status quo. <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: Complete the wrong thing. <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a planning document.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We know what we want to do.

## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->

- None
