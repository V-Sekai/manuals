# Proposed: Face helmet capture

### Context and Problem Statement

With a face helmet we can capture the face movement reliably.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We don't have a way to talk to v-sekai for capture.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Run the v-sekai app
2. Export either VMC or Godot Networking protocol for facial tracking
3. Open question on how to have tracking.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I have the raw materials to do this.
