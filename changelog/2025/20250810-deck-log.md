- **Planning**
  - What ik tasks are still needed?
  - qa / integration testing with test cases.
  - The height offset / armspan is a known issue
  - I think people had trouble testing because it is hard to load an avatar and we are very dependent on uro.
  - Try to get the in-app signup flow working and push stage to be the main site
  - And audio like you say would be cool to get working
