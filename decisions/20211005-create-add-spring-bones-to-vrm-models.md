# Draft: Create a standard procedure from adding spring bones to VRM models

## Context and Problem Statement

Create a standard operating procedure from adding spring bones to VRM models.

## Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

By adding spring bones the body doesn't clip through clothing or hair.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Secondary is a node under the root.

Use `VRM Spring Bone Collider Group` to stop spring bones from clipping with the skeleton.

Add the root bones of the armature you want to animate.

Is it possible to generate a humanoid collider groups?

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Instructions are needed, automation is work.

## Positive Consequences

_No response_

## Negative Consequences

_No response_

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I don't know and it's in my area so I need to know.
