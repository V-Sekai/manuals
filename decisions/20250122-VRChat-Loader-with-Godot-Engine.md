## What is the context of the proposal?

We plan to integrate a VRChat loader that fetches scenes from a Godot Engine HTTP server, enabling dynamic content updates.

## What is the problem being solved?

Allow external tools to efficiently modify and synchronize the world environment to facilitate updates and management of complex scenes in VRChat.

### GLB with Repacked DDS Support

Implement a protocol in Godot Engine for HTTP GET requests of GLB files with repacked DDS textures.

This solution could broaden social VR possibilities. However, before adopting it as the core, a thorough review of feasibility and integration with VRChat is necessary.
