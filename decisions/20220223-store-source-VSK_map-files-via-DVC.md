## Context and Problem Statement

How do I version control large binary game assets?

Need a procedure to version control large file folders like game map levels.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Propose using DVC as the version control system on top of git with a S3 remote on Digital Ocean.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Initial list of binaries to transfer to DVC

Use a Linux command to get the top 20 by size file types.

- `*.glb`
- `*.gltf`
- `*.bin*`
- `*.png`
- `*.webp`
- `*.jpg`
- `*.jpeg`
- `*.exr`
- `*.scn`

### Remotes

S3 Compatible has multiple implementations. Intent on using digital ocean spaces.

### Permissions vs Cost

- Permissions?
- Open bucket
- Cost of storage

### Installing

- <https://dvc.org/doc/install/windows>
  - <https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases/download/2.9.5/dvc-2.9.5.exe>
- <https://dvc.org/doc/install/linux>

### Test using chibifire dvc bucket and the avatar wellness repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fire/avatar-wellness.git
dvc init
dvc remote add -d chibifire-dvc-web https://chibifire.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dvc/
# dvc remote add --local chibifire-dvc-s3 s3://chibifire/dvc
# dvc remote modify --local chibifire-dvc-s3 endpointurl sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com
# dvc remote modify --local chibifire-dvc-s3 access_key_id 'AAAA'
# dvc remote modify --local chibifire-dvc-s3 secret_access_key 'BBBB'
dvc config core.autostage true
```

### A V-Sekai alternative organization for creator

Discussed with Lyuma how it is possible to make a V-Sekai alternative organization for creator repositories.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to version control maps.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Usability now has a gap.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Do not use DVC remote on Google drive.
- Rejection Reason: Google Drive does not have two implementations

- Option: Use Github with git-lfs
- Rejection Reason: The last time I checked it was 50 USD per 50 gigabytes.

- Option: Use Gitlab git-lfs
- Rejection Reason: There is slightly larger limit on <https://gitlab.com> git-lfs but gitlab.com does not scale with usage.

- Option: Use Gitlab.com
- Rejection Reason: Gitlab.com commrcial is expensive

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

A version control system and object stores are not trivial and hard.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We want to present V-Sekai maps for others to remix.
