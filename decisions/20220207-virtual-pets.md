## Context and Problem Statement

We were chatting late night and the idea of a virtual pet game was challenged.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

### Design 1

1. VRM with spring bones
1. reverse bone direction
1. Simulate virtual pet behaviors

### Design 2

- springbone/constraint/follower (will clip through geom)
- physics
- navmesh (bake at runtime?)
- raycast

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Wanted to create a virtual reality pet game where the pet was a character that was beside you in game and networked. The virtual pet would be with you in the game.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to backtrack ideas.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Work

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Forgetting decisions.
- Rejection Reason: We won't remember the original reasons why we did things.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a small amount of scripting.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are running the project.
