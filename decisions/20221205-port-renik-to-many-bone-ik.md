## Context and Problem Statement

Renik is a character controller and many bone ik is an ik solver. We have not merged them.

The quality is low for the FABRIK solver.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We wish to merge many bone ik and renik to improve quality.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Replace renik's usage of FABRIK with many bone ik.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

1. Better animation quality

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

IK is hard and not a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We know how to do it.
