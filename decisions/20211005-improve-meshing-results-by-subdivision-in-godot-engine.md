# Draft: Improve Meshing Results by Subdivision in Godot Engine

## Context and Problem Statement

For characters subdivision surfaces allow the ability to conserve authoring while also scaling polygons.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Using subdivision surfaces in Godot is useful.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

- Implement subdivision
- Is the UI based on LOD multiples?

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Can be done by other people.
