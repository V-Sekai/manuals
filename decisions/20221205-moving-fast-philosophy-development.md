## Context and Problem Statement

We want to discover ways to move faster.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to discover ways to move faster and last longer.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Prototype quickly and be adaptive to change.

We use continuous integration and continuous deployment.

We record our decisions in documentation.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

We improve our processes.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Processes become dead weight.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is not code but a workflow document.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We work on V-Sekai.
