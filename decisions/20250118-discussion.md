# Accepted: V-Sekai discussion Jan 18, 2025

Why do people care about V-Sekai?

Materialist perspective for building the metaverse.

Reputation / trust system

Groups who have found a way to express themselves better using the metaverse:

- Trans community
- Furry community
- Helping hands

Games:

  Homo Ludens

System of games. Example: playground games such as foursquare have their own house rules.

Why can we build a system peacefully?

As long as people are encouraed to engage with VR, can create peace.

Routes: creativity. Seed of acknowledging the work that we do for one another.

Platform ideas:

- Elder care (Hospice and retirement communities). Post-scarcity setting.

After godot is adopted, libraries can legally host games. also, AI models.

Assumption that there will be more indie games rather than AAA.

Target devices:

PC (hope to support Linux via Proton, until Linux users contrib fixes and support)
Android (SquarePeg: Amazon Fire HD tablet has good value, like $50). Also Samsung.

Haven idea:

You have your world which can be for example a grassy plane.

You can have nested worlds or spaces within the space.

- Exist on multiple planes:
  Platform plane ("main shard"). here are the popular buildings near each other. User tags for worlds (for you page)

Geographic plane (worlds which are tied to your geographic region)

Havens tied to groups. Intentionally place. Allow players to recommend spaces (portal?).

Facilitates both people adventuring, for example traveling in some direction. Or a world browser.

Party system where you define a party leader, and you can explore that person's haven

Haven and world scale.

Permissions. Have ways for people without much technical understanding to make changes to the world. (Wiki Wiki Web)

We want to avoid a Guild City where only people with domain expertise are able to make contributions.
