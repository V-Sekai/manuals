## Context and Problem Statement

It's hard to get access to V-Sekai.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Let's strip down our V-Sekai prototype and make it work for WebXR.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Upgrade to 3.4 Godot Engine

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Took too much effort to verify.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is not a few lines of code and is a V-Sekai core topic.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain core V-Sekai.
