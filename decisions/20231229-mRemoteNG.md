## The Backdrop

A need for efficient and effective remote access to multiple devices. As the world becomes more interconnected, the ability to manage and control various devices remotely has become crucial.

## The Challenge

Software that can log into multiple devices, providing users with the ability to perform tasks on those devices without physical access.

## The Strategy

According to [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/mobaxterm/?license=opensource), mRemoteNG is a popular open-source alternative to MobaXterm. It's a fork of mRemote, an open source, tabbed, multi-protocol, remote connections manager.

Key points:

- mRemoteNG is the most popular Windows alternative to MobaXterm.
- mRemoteNG is the most popular Open Source & free alternative to MobaXterm.

## The Upside

The upside of using mRemoteNG is its versatility and cost-effectiveness. Being an open-source tool, it allows for customization and improvements from the user community. It also supports multiple protocols for managing remote connections.

## The Downside

The downside could be the potential learning curve associated with using a new tool. Additionally, as it is open-source, support might not be as readily available or comprehensive as with commercial software.

## The Road Not Taken

The road not taken would be sticking with traditional, possibly proprietary, terminal emulators. While these may offer robust features and dedicated support, they often come at a significant cost and lack the flexibility of open-source solutions.

## The Infrequent Use Case

An infrequent use case might be using mRemoteNG for managing a small number of devices or connections. In such cases, the full potential of the tool may not be utilized.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This strategy is not in core and done by us. It involves leveraging an existing open-source solution to address our needs.
