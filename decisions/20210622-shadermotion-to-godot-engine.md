# Draft: Convert #shadermotion to be played in Godot Engine

## Context and Problem Statement

We want a better way of importing animations to Godot Engine. Unfortunately, there is no standard way to exchange motion from other places to Godot and work interchangeably on different characters.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

# shadermotion files in video format provide an excellent way to record motion. However, we want the ability to play it back in Godot Engine onto a VRM character.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Install youtube-dl and ffmpeg with scoop

`scoop install youtube-dl ffmpeg`

Convert #shadermotion videos into WebM VP9.

`youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmwqDOin_Zt4WCMWqoK6SdHlg0C_WeCP6 --audio-format wav --format webm --recode-video webm`

Crop the preview frame of the video for the left and the right side.

```
ffmpeg -i "NNNN.webm" "-filter:v" "crop=in_w*(1-0.925):ih:0:0,fps=60,scale=24x180:flags=lanczos+full_chroma_inp" shader_motion_character_00.webm
ffmpeg -i "NNNN.webm" "-filter:v" "crop=in_w*(1-0.925):in_h:in_w:in_h,fps=60,scale=24x180:flags=lanczos+full_chroma_inp" shader_motion_character_0
```

## How to build Godot video decoder

Build godot-cpp

```
godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe --gdnative-generate-json-api api.json
godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe --gdnative-generate-json-builtin-api builtin_api.json
# copy to godot-cpp
# compile godot-cpp
# Use instructions for 4
# https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openvr/pull/123#issue-658898644
scons p=windows target=release -j16 target=release generate_bindings=yes
# compile gdnative-video-decoder
scons platform=win64 target=release -j16
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Can interchange motions

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Complexity

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

The ability to give motion to 3d characters or NPCS is important.

The ability to interchange pose is important.
