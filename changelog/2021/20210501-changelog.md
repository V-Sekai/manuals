- 2021-05-21 22:51:16Z lyuma: "I worked with fire on debugging glTF. I think we're going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.

  1. Radical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.
  2. Add BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.
  3. While in `_determine_skeletons`, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actually add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the `_determine_skeletons` code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.

  Bugs:

  1. Animations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects
  2. We ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.
  3. MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints? The glb here should have a spinning diamond and two spinning skinned cubes:" <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845433592888557568/MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3.glb>

- 2021-05-21 22:29:43Z fire: We also gain the ability to post more twitter tweets.
- 2021-05-21 22:29:23Z fire: Had a discussion with Lyuma and Saracen about V-Sekai for wider testing and how it was blocked by scene validation feature.
- 2021-05-21 15:27:33Z fire: Multiple PRs from fire and Lyuma were merged for gltf problems
- 2021-05-20 15:28:19Z fire: „Éà„Ç´„Ç≤ <https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-fire/commits/features/skeleton-gizmos> I did some cleanup, rebased on the modification stack and changed the color for selected bones to be a darker orange
- 2021-05-20 15:26:43Z fire: Lyuma IK and Modification stack are now a stacked branch.
- 2021-05-20 04:21:06Z fire: Work with Lyuma on 3 glTF bug fixes. 1. instead of failing all the meshes only fail once 2. the skins duplication removal code has a bug and it needs to check skin bind bone, skin bind name and pose transform. 3. the skin bind code was removed 4. gltf 4.0 modules was backported to 3.2
- 2021-05-19 19:20:41Z fire: Lyuma and I summarized our concerns about the ease of implementation and the inability to use off the shelf code.
- 2021-05-19 19:20:00Z fire: OMI Week 3. Stayed for the talk at 9am and then stayed with Robert Long to talk about OMI Identity and misc things like there is no opensource OpenXR mobile client. <https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/issues/36#issuecomment-844392614>
- 2021-05-19 14:37:19Z fire: After sleeping on the Linux RPM database problem, I was able to get WSL working again. Lyuma I needed to switch WSL to version 2.

- 2021-05-18 14:46:44Z fire: GSOC 2021 started on Monday. Will be mentoring Theoway and on the topic of Visual Script node visual organization
- 2021-05-18 14:43:56Z fire: Posted my last revision of runtime export <https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-fire/tree/extended-fire-master-runtime-gltf>
- 2021-05-18 14:01:58Z fire: Lyuma Please see xr channel in godot about runtime gltf. May be too politically diffficult to get merged, so will fix gltf export bugs

- 2021-05-16 22:58:19Z Saracen: Added further bug fixes to runtime switching of VR mode and flat mode. Fixes the few minor remaining issues with the avatar poses getting messed up, and the VR controllers being stuck on screen. With that, I'm satisfied with marking this feature as done in the tracker.
- 2021-05-16 22:22:05Z fire: Work around found. Import into godot and then export it as glb again.
- 2021-05-16 22:17:37Z fire: Submitted a blender gltf bug report. <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1392> üòÆ (1)

- 2021-05-16 21:15:45Z lyuma: "I hope the code I wrote will help others as a template for making nice-looking inspectors.

I am considering submitting Godot-MToon-Shader to the asset library, separately from VRM."

- 2021-05-16 21:15:12Z lyuma: Using much the same cursed techniques that many Unity inspectors use, I was able to create bold headings, and "single-line" texture+image property pickers.
- 2021-05-16 21:13:39Z lyuma: In some ways, it's a bit more clunky than the `get_property_list()`, and a bit less versatile in terms of what you can do... but I decided to think outside the VBoxContainer a little bit, and I came up with a reasonable inspector, I think.
- 2021-05-16 21:11:54Z lyuma: Spent most of the day learning how to make a custom shader inspector using EditorInspectorPlugin. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/843596648855896084/mtoon_shader_inspector.png>

- 2021-05-16 15:11:34Z fire: Brainstorming an intermediate format that isn't exact per bone joint orientation but general across characters
- 2021-05-16 05:53:14Z fire: Investigating ShaderMotion. Now that I can go from some anims to Unity Mechanism / UE4 / VRM skeletons, I want to investigate writing a shader motion player.
- 2021-05-16 01:16:04Z lyuma: <https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm> godot3 branch (Godot 3.3): Runtime support requires no patches. Editor requires gltf module. master branch: Runtime support requires no patches. Editor requires two small engine fixes.
- 2021-05-16 01:13:55Z lyuma: Getting very close to a releasable fully featured (Import-only) VRM addon for Godot. Let me know what you think in #pipeline <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/843295167603015700/godot_vrm_1.0.0_beta.mp4>

- 2021-05-15 14:36:56Z lyuma: wiping history on V-Sekai/godot-vrm will be necessary because some large binary files were pushed in the past, and I want to ensure this addon is lightweight and easy to clone.
- 2021-05-15 14:33:39Z lyuma: "Pushed an update to Godot-VRM for godot 3.x: <https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm/tree/gd3>
  It's not finalized yet and I will do a bit more testing and bugfixing before rebasing/wiping all of history pushing it to `godot3`, its final resting place."
- 2021-05-14 15:00:58Z Saracen: Fixed some bugs to improve support for switching between VR and flat modes at runtime. Very ugly hack to fix one of the bugs though, strange issue. Some slight remaining avatar issues, but it's _mostly_ working now it seems.
- 2021-05-14 02:17:44Z fire: Added three pictures and a video.
- 2021-05-14 01:33:44Z fire: VOX to VRM fun. (Autorigging investigation for any static humanoid mesh!)
- 2021-05-13 21:38:00Z lyuma: but yeah! It's really exciting to get this much imported with just a couple clicks and about 30 seconds of waiting
- 2021-05-13 21:37:01Z lyuma: it's a bit of random chance that it looks so similar: the skydome and some objects like flowers have completely custom shaders, so those will have to be ported manually
- 2021-05-13 21:36:32Z Saracen: This is actually starting to look like the original now
- 2021-05-13 21:36:27Z Saracen: Woah!
- 2021-05-13 21:36:04Z lyuma: Unidot Importer: Got lighting and basic environment settings importing. In squiddingme's Traveler's Rift, I'm now able to bake lighting immediately after importing. (You can see the probes are baking as black, so there are still some issues to be worked out.) - Also added support for audio, cameras and reflection probes: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/842515566413873172/unknown.png>

- 2021-05-13 18:12:28Z lyuma: Jin's proposal does not make sense
- 2021-05-13 18:12:21Z lyuma: Vrm is an avatar format which requires a rigged humanoid model. Obj does not support rigging

- 2021-05-13 06:35:51Z Saracen: Tweaked the way wristspan is calculated since it came out wrong on some avatars where the arms weren't perfectly aligned. Should result in more accurate VR proportions.
- 2021-05-13 04:26:05Z fire: Rebased my godot 4.0 stack so I can go back to my vrm viewer thing
- 2021-05-13 03:14:34Z Saracen: One more patch just to allow direct assignment of upper and lower bones by ID, but it seems to be working now. Good job! It's now possible to use avatars with in-between bones.
- 2021-05-13 03:00:37Z Saracen: Basically, the new code to automatically assign the next bone in the chain assumed the skeleton was assigned, even though it can be null.
- 2021-05-13 02:55:04Z MMMaellon#2053 whoa wait why was it crashing

- 2021-05-11 15:38:00Z fire: Anything from Vive Con?
- 2021-05-11 13:49:22Z lyuma: Fixed an issue in EWBIK that was bothering me -- namely, that the result of the algorithm appeared to depend on the root bone having an identity transform. It seems that all that was needed was to transform the "tip" and "target" headings of an IKBoneChain by the inverse transform of the root. <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/841673340740829234/unknown.png> üåÖ (1)
- 2021-05-11 03:32:10Z fire: Whoo debugged EWBIK the entire day, and removed the hacks to reveal the broken core to be rebuilt! Thanks Eron!
- 2021-05-10 17:21:03Z fire: Evaluated EWBIK with Motion Retargeting. Suggestions included adding a position indication (with scale) as a child of the correction node that is a child of the bone attachment and olving only one frame at a time. No conclusions yet, because ewbik is too broken.
- 2021-05-10 02:48:21Z fire: Working with Eron on ewbik. Next meeting at 9am or later.
- 2021-05-09 22:31:35Z fire: Working out a system where we create targets from the other skeletal animation using bone attachments and then a corresponding correction node underneath it. The ik solver then uses those correction node targets as the target.
- 2021-05-09 17:22:13Z Saracen: Support for ordered grid super sampling and camera position-based bill-boarding added thanks to help from Silent and Lyuma
- 2021-05-09 16:08:30Z fire: Many patches from „Éà„Ç´„Ç≤ were merged today \o/. Thanks

- 2021-05-08 10:43:35Z lyuma: (Though, I also have not yet implemented world environment. Also, you can see it fails to port custom shaders like the skybox.)
- 2021-05-08 10:42:42Z lyuma: squiddingme helped provide me with source files to their beautiful Traveler's Rift, and I am finally able to import it using Unidot. This part was all automated, and includes collision meshes for all of the separate pickup objects, as well as light sources. <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/840539201987936306/TravelersRift.jpg> üëç (1)

- 2021-05-08 06:30:40Z MMMaellon#2053 You were talking about it the other day, but all that I got was that it was difficult to set up. idk what it actually did
- 2021-05-08 06:30:13Z MMMaellon#2053 what does matrix server giv us?
- 2021-05-08 06:28:45Z lyuma: "1. We set up a matrix server in 5 hours (a few hours wasted due to firewall).

2. We set up federation to the matrix server in an SRV record
   Next steps?
1. Try godot-matrix to see if we can use the matrix server for interop. (Are there similar bindings for other languages?)
1. See if we can boil everything down to be easy to set up.
1. What is matrix actually useful for? Identity? Establishing E2E messages? Sending invites? How does federation help?"

- 2021-05-07 13:51:55Z fire: EWBIK bone dampening is implemented.
- 2021-05-07 11:09:14Z fire: > You won't need stabilization before you've implemented constraints.
- 2021-05-07 11:08:49Z fire: "Ewbik todo. dampening is about getting a natural pose,
  stabilization is about preventing wobbling when a lot of constraints are being violated."
