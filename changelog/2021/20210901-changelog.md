- 2021-09-27 14:32:29Z fire: Wrote down a bake miku miku motion workflow. With a rebased 3.x (not 3.3) we can export the baked scene with a manual step to delete the face / blendshapes. Remember to copy both the reset and the transferred anim. Then in 4.0 import and put it on the original vrm. Enable RESET bake.
- 2021-09-27 14:26:53Z fire: Reviewed godot-tests pr and had some comments. Added a comment to fix export of skeletons and skins. Tested the export more. Noted a weird issue where if the blend was animated it would cause the blend shape to be exported wrong. Like `a` shape mouth blend set to 1.0 and looking in blender

  Cause for failure: Fedora (without NetworkManager?) defaults to non-daemonized dhclient and allowed the dhcp lease to expire.

To prevent future disruption, I have implemented both mitigations outlined in this helpful ServerFault answer!

To correct, I edited /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service
and changed the ExecStart lines to:

- 2021-09-18 12:41:48Z fire: "> WOW.... workarounds galore and its not pretty, and it crashes badly when you exit Godot, but OpenVR is breathing life and renders to the headset now. That means that the system at its core is working and we're now at a stage of fixing bugs (well I still need to finish the changes to controllers).

> For OpenXR there is far more work to do because there currently isn't any support for rendering to texture chains supplied by the plugin and I'm only about halfway through converting all the code.
> I plan to do more on that conversion tomorrow as I wait for things to be fixed in Godot before I can take the next steps with OpenVR."

- 2021-09-08 17:24:52Z fire: Lyuma Saracen from reduz > fire it looks good. We got quite a lot of demand to make the GLTF importer part of core, given it is needed for VR and other stuff, so I have the feeling we should optimize it for performance (which we should do anyway) and have an option to load actual meshes instead of EditorImporterMesh.. so that means we would need to provide a function to parse the mesh node into a scene node and the editor supplies, otherwise it uses Mesh as a default

- 2021-09-04 01:30:12Z lyuma: We found an infinite recursion bug in the godot gltf exporter caused by the construction of gltf node objects from skeletons and skins. I believe the issue is treating skeletons as special objects, and if we expand skeleton bones to nodes initially that should simplify things greatly and prevent this type of bug.

- 2021-09-02 03:56:26Z lyuma: "Progress on Unidot Importer: I made some major fixes on binary asset deserialization: I finally figured out how padding works (short answer: flag 0x4000 adds padding after a byte or short), and fixed a crash by implementing support for Unity 4.x and earlier assets, since you never know where they will show up.

Next up is parsing the texture filename mapping from FBX files to assist in material discovery, since Unity legacy materials default to lookup by texture _filename_ rather than material name or texture name. Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won't quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest. Will probably revisit this decision later." üëç (4)
