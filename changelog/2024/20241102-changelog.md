# V-Sekai Changelog - November 2024

- Experimental (ðŸ§ª): This stage is for features still being tested and may not be stable.
- Feature complete (ðŸŽ¯): This stage is for features with all planned functionality implemented.
- Beta (ðŸš§): This stage is for essentially complete features that may still have bugs.
- General release (ðŸš€): This stage is for features that have been thoroughly tested and are now released.

## [Released]

- ðŸš€ V-Sekai discord onboarding is now enabled.
- ðŸ§ª Updated godot-sandbox [json_diff_sample cmake sample](https://github.com/libriscv/godot-sandbox-demo/tree/master/json_diff_sample)
- ðŸ§ª Updated godot-sandbox [weight transfer sample](https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/godot-sandbox-robust-weight-transfer)
- ðŸ§ª Prototype a repository for visual anomaly detection with Anomalib. [V-Sekai-fire/godot-visual-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/godot-visual-anomaly-detection)
- ðŸš§ [ifiregames.itch.io/godot-motion-matching](https://ifiregames.itch.io/godot-motion-matching)
- ðŸ§ª [V-Sekai/world-editor](https://github.com/V-Sekai/world-editor)
- ðŸš€ [Ughuuu/gdextension-to-module](https://github.com/Ughuuu/gdextension-to-module)
- ðŸš€ Walk the Dog is a vector-quantized periodic autoencoder. Walk the Dog is now MIT-licensed open source. It learns a disconnected 1D phase manifold that aligns motion regardless of morphologies while requiring no paired data or any joint correspondence [PeizhuoLi/walk-the-dog](https://github.com/PeizhuoLi/walk-the-dog)
- ðŸš€ Submitted an update to Godot-VRM version 2.1.0, adding much-needed support for Godot 4.3 SkeletonModifier3D, an import (or runtime) option to adjust the head hiding method, and several bug fixes. It will be released on the asset library when approved, likely next week, but it can be downloaded from GitHub.
  Known issues: Node constraints are still imported incorrectly because they are not adjusted for rotated bones during retargeting. Newer VRM features, such as VRMA animation, still need support.
- ðŸŽ¯ <https://github.com/V-Sekai/world-godot> and <https://github.com/V-Sekai/world-kit> are now the new repository of Godot Engine and the world kit.

## Ask yourself why the fuck aren't released yet?

1. No one wants to work on our game because it's a fork of the godot engine -> we made a godot-sandbox as a gdextension.
1. I must learn to hyper-scale godot networking -> greater than 25 players. Shared databases in the cloud are not good. Authoritative ownership schemes are ok.
1. We need things to do -> Begin a metro transit hub system that connects the world.
