## The Backdrop  

Constantly changing blender versions is a problem for blender import
  
## The Challenge  

We want to pin the blender version.
  
## The Strategy  

Pin the blender version to the steam version of LTS Blender -- Blender (3.6)
  
## The Upside  

We get the fast upgrades of steam and the pinning requirement satisified.
  
## The Downside  

Dependent on steam.

## The Road Not Taken  

Download a version of Blender directly.
  
## The Infrequent Use Case  

Ask someone to use blender for you.
