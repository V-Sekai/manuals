## The Backdrop

In the world of software development, having a robust and user-friendly terminal environment is crucial. Developers often need to manage multiple terminal sessions at once, which can be challenging without the right tools.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to find a usable terminal multiplexer that can handle multiple terminal sessions efficiently and effectively.

## The Strategy

Our strategy is to use Byobu, a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. It was chosen for its ease of use and robust feature set.

## The Upside

By using Byobu, developers can easily manage multiple terminal sessions from a single interface. This can greatly improve productivity and efficiency.

## The Downside

As with any tool, there may be a learning curve associated with Byobu. However, its benefits far outweigh this minor inconvenience.

## The Road Not Taken

Other options like Screen and tmux were considered but found not as user friendly. Tmux, in particular, didn't correctly scroll and did not advertise the option to start on terminal.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While Byobu is an excellent tool for managing multiple terminal sessions, it may not be necessary for developers who only occasionally need to work with multiple terminals.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This decision to use Byobu is part of our core strategy to provide the best tools and environment for our developers.
