### Positive Consequences

I can finally store things.

### Negative Consequences

Pay for the baserow service.

### Option graveyard

- Rejected using premium saas from baserow
- Rejected using airtable

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code, but fairly simple.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I need to store things.
