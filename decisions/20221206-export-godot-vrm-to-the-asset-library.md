## Context and Problem Statement

<!-- Describe the problem or limitation you are having in your project. You may want to articulate the problem in the form of a question. -->

We want to prepare godot-vrm for asset library publishing, but the format for publishing is incompatible with development.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We convert godot-vrm into a format suitable for development and then write a converter to a format ready for the asset library.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

How to migrate to Godot-VRM to submodule format?

The thing Lyuma got blocked on is that VRM contains two addons: VRM and Godot-MToon-Shader

Revive the Godot-MToon-Shader repository which Lyuma previously archived.

But Lyuma will change it so it's only the submodule (contents of the addons folder) and then Lyuma will make the Godot VRM addon (submodule) a branch in the godot-vrm repository

Then we'll make a script to sync the changes to/from the godot-vrm example project which we submit to asset lib

Writing this up for Fire, since we talked about the issue with addons/vrm being duplicated in multiple projects since Godot Asset Library doesn't allow submodules / raw addons folders.

Did some unarchiving and renames so that <https://github.com/V-Sekai/Godot-MToon-Shader> gets the top google slot

1. Make sure the godot-vrm code is synced up with other repositories where it was duplicated.
2. Make a mtoon addon repository with a copy of the Godot-MToon-Shader code.
3. Make a branch in godot-vrm with ONLY the 4.0 vrm addon, usable as a submodule.
4. Change v-sekai-game and other similar projects to use Godot-MToon-Shader and vrm as a submodules
5. Write a script to sync up repository contents from one to the other.

### is_empty()

Is there a functional difference between `if not stringvar.is_empty():` vs `if stringvar != "":` x != "" is a bit shorter and easier to type, but I noticed some recommendation to use is_empty().

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

We don't have duplicate godot-vrm copies and the copies stay in sync.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Asset library copy is different than development.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. We have duplicate development versions. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a repository layout and not code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the godot-vrm and the mtoon repositories.
