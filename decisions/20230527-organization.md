## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai is a project aimed at creating an open-source, federated virtual world platform. The main challenge faced by the V-Sekai project is to compete with established platforms like Roblox, which has a massive user base and a market valuation of $41 billion. The problem lies in finding ways to attract users, developers, and creators while maintaining a sustainable economic model.

## Proposed Solution

To address the limitations of V-Sekai and make it competitive with platforms like Roblox, the following solutions are proposed:

1. Implement a V-Sekai currency system: Convert fiat currency into in-game currency.
2. Charge a fee for adding money into the system: This will help generate revenue for the platform and maintain its sustainability.
3. Creators are paid directly for their content from V-Sekai.
4. Prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution of resources.

## Implementation

1. Integrate a payment gateway to charge fees for adding money into the system.
2. Implement usage limits for players and creators to ensure fair resource allocation.
3. Offer creators a reward for their work.

## Positive Consequences

- Attracting more creators and users to the platform
- Generating revenue to sustain the platform's growth
- Ensuring fair distribution of resources among users and creators
- Encouraging creators to have a fair share in the platform.

## Negative Consequences

- Potential backlash from users due to fees and usage limits
- Legal complexities in treating creators fairly.
- Balancing the currency system to prevent inflation or deflation

## Option graveyard

Implementing a single currency system: This option was discarded due to the potential for abuse and difficulty in balancing the economy.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, the proposed solution requires significant changes to the platform's core architecture and cannot be achieved through simple scripting.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, the proposed solution addresses fundamental limitations of the V-Sekai project and is essential for its success. It requires deep integration with the platform's core systems and should be implemented by the core development team.
