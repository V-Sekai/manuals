### Proposal Title

Play preprocessed animations on any VRM model.

### Context and Problem Statement

Given any vrm and a carefully made animation, we should be able to play back the animation.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Need to work out a flow for making animations play back on vrm.

**This is dependency for a VRM based character controller that can play existing animation clips and blend them**

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

???

Collaborate with Saracen on a bone roll corrected VRM skeleton.

Convert animations to VRM named bones.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We control the default animation tree, therefore we need to do this.
