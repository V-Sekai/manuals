# Draft: We want to proxy udp datagrams at production quality of service

### Context and Problem Statement

We want to proxy udp datagrams at production quality of service.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The ability to proxy V-Sekai game datagrams is an important part of the player experience.

We require that the proxy is able to handle both versions of DTLS inside of WebRTC and also with ENET.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

No idea.

#### WIP

- WireGuard in Cilium allows mesh kubernetes clustering

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Networking and game networking are not a few lines of code. Game networking is game specific and the quality matters.

### Positive Consequences

- Allows greater access to potential users.
- Web browser support requires webrtc.

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own game networking.
