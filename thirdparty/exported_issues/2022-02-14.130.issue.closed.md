Worked with mauve

## Test plan

1. Two local area network clients (godot-sqlite-webtorrent)
2. Mutable webtorrent BEP 44 sharing Godot engine binaries via a local area network client (godot-sqlite-libtorrent) 

## Rejected Alternatives

* IPFS because it is still flaky
* Hypercore

## Features Required

* The BEP 44 stuff uses the DHT (global dynamic hash table)
* The local-peer discovery uses DNS-SD

## The SQLite as a file trick.

https://app-next.actualbudget.com/budget

We have a single file web app that uses SQLite as WASM, and SQLite stores the database.

http://static.wiki/en/Godot_(game_engine) - example of one immutable chunk uses HTTP range queries (not the above multiple chunks) 

You can combine the immutable HTTP range queue with multiple chunks. This Wikipedia archive is one 44 GB file on a content distribution network.

## Tricks

Imagine storing this day's virtual world uploads to one SQLite file in like 10/100GB chunks. 

\<Mauve> Particularly having the ability to have indexes in there

The second trick is we can have BitTorrent do range queries.

\<Mauve>One TODO would be to figure out how those SQLite files get authored, or how individuals get their data in there

The third trick is webtorrent mutable chunks additions.

Not vr locomotion or networked object picking. Postponing.
