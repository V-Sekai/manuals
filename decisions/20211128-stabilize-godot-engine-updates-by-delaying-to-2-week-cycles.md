## Context and Problem Statement

Stabilize Godot Engine updates because the update broke Groups broke once.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We use multiple ways to harden Godot Engine.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Delay to around 2 week cycles
1. Move V-Sekai godot to use a branch that is not tracked with Godot Engine master.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- More stability

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Losing the pulse of Godot Engine development.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script in core.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain the engine.
