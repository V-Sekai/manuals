patch\", because\n\n- Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.\n  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on.\n  See also [A rational design process: How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a `draft` status, to enable collaborative writing.\n- Add a `Tags` field.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20210212-use-log4brains-to-manage-the-adrs\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Use
