## Context and Problem Statement

Find or create a **VR design application** offering a variety of powerful _polygon mesh-based sculpting tools_, suitable for both aspiring creatives and experienced 3D artists.

## Describe the problem or limitation you have in your project, e.g., in free form, using two to three sentences. Consider articulating the case in the form of a question.

Currently, V-Sekai lacks a comprehensive VR design application that provides polygon mesh-based sculpting tools for users with varying levels of experience. How can we integrate such a tool to enhance the creative capabilities of our users?

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Integrate a powerful VR design application, such as Gravity Sketch, which offers a wide range of polygon mesh-based sculpting tools. This will cater to both beginners and experienced 3D artists, allowing them to create intricate designs within the V-Sekai environment.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Research available VR design applications that meet the requirements.
2. Evaluate the compatibility of the chosen application with V-Sekai.
3. Develop an integration plan, including necessary API calls and user interface adjustments.
4. Implement the integration, ensuring seamless functionality within V-Sekai.
5. Test the integrated application with various user profiles to ensure usability and performance.

## Positive Consequences

- Enhanced creative capabilities for V-Sekai users.
- Attraction of a wider user base, including experienced 3D artists.
- Improved user satisfaction and engagement.

## Negative Consequences

- Potential increase in system requirements for V-Sekai.
- Additional development time and resources required for integration.

## Option graveyard

- Developing a custom VR design application from scratch (time-consuming and resource-intensive).

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, as the enhancement involves integrating a complex VR design application that cannot be achieved through a simple script workaround.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, integrating a powerful VR design application will significantly enhance the creative capabilities of V-Sekai users, making it a core feature that directly impacts user experience and satisfaction.
