### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a list of core features.
