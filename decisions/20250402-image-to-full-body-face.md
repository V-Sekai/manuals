# Proposed: Image to Full Body FACS

## Context

This system builds a robust image-to-full-body-face mapping pipeline to capture real-world 3D full-body movements synchronized with visual data. Key metrics include anatomical accuracy of motion prediction, scalability across diverse body types, and real-time processing capabilities. This proposal addresses the growing demand for realistic full-body animation in virtual avatars, gaming, and biomechanical analysis. It matters now due to advancements in computer vision and the need for cost-effective motion capture solutions beyond lab-controlled environments.

## Problem Statement

Primary operational challenges include:

1. Lack of accessible systems for accurate 3D full-body motion capture from 2D images/video
2. Difficulty generating anatomically plausible animations from imperfect visual data
3. High computational costs of existing marker-based motion capture systems
4. Limited adaptability to real-world environmental noise and occlusion

## Proposed Solution

An image-to-FACS pipeline combining synthetic data generation, biomechanical constraints, and reinforcement learning:

- Convert T-posed animations to VRM avatar format with COCO keypoint annotations
- Generate synthetic training data using Godot Engine with marker/color variations
- Leverage MediaPipe for video-to-keypoint conversion with vertex-based facial mapping
- Train custom prediction models using temporal-spatial attention mechanisms

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create VRM synthetic datasets with ground truth annotations
2. Develop MediaPipe integration for unified body-face-hand keypoint extraction
3. Implement reinforcement learning (GRPO) for motion generation from masked video

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Synthetic Data Pipeline
   - Develop Animation-to-VRM conversion tools
   - Generate multi-format synthetic data in Godot Engine
2. **Phase 2**: Keypoint Prediction Model
   - Train transformer-based model on synthetic/real data mixtures
   - Integrate biomechanical constraints into loss functions
3. **Validation**:
   - Success Criteria: >90% anatomical validity in user studies
   - Failure Threshold: <15% improvement over baseline MediaPipe accuracy
