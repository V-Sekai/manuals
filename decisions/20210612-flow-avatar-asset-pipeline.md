# Draft: Convert FBX and glTF2 to VRM via flow-avatar-asset-pipeline

## Context and Problem Statement

How to convert FBX and glTF2 to VRM?

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

If we can convert FBX and glTF to VRM we have a reliable way of importing things to groups.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Convert avatar-asset-pipeline to use the membrane framework.

Have the concept of a source glb we run again as many individual solvers for the input data.

Once the input is solved and it passes QA, that is one that is the outputted.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- We have a standard way of importing characters.
- We already have elixir backend infrastructure.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Have no humans in the loop can be bad for quality assurance.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option:

- <https://github.com/infosia/avatar-asset-pipeline>

- Rejection Reason:

- Need to integrate with backend.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Non trivial.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core part of Groups and we depend on it.
