It involves loading only portions of the animation data as needed, which helps manage memory efficiently and ensures smooth playback without requiring the entire animation to be loaded into memory simultaneously.\n\n\n\nWe need a system to handle the streaming of long animations in a way that minimizes memory usage and ensures smooth playback. The system should be configurable and handle various animation lengths and complexities.\n\n\n\nWe have a resource, AnimationStreamingData, which, when exported, is a custom binary resource containing animation pages.

I would like to know the number of pages, time, or size. Time is best, say 3 seconds.\nHave a particular track for streamed animations. Always load the first 3 seconds of animation (buffer size).

A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.\nA line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nEasy Charts"

    "text": "Mozilla Builders Summer MVP Lab (SUBMITTED ON JUNE 8 2020)\nDid you apply for our Spring MVP Lab program?\nCheck this if at least one team member applied.\nOne line summary of the MVP:\nA fully remixable and self-hosted collaborative VR environment based on Godot Engine.\nDescription of the product: What will the MVP be in 8 weeks?\nOur standalone Virtual Reality (VR) application will be usable from all SteamVR compatible PC headsets, as well as the mobile Oculus Quest VR platform. The MVP features a social hub with both 3D spatialized voice and realtime upper body tracking, with simple games, physics and social video viewing.\nCategory Category\n\nCollaboration & Society\nDecentralized Web : YES\nMessaging & Social Networking : YES\nSurveillance Capitalism\nMisinformation & Content\nArtificial Intelligence\nWeb Assembly\n\nCheck all that apply.\nOptional Video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2PTDXG1Hc4\nWhy does your idea matter: How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet, or make the internet more awesome? * The core principles of the Internet are openness and communication. We see VR as the basis for a new frontier of communication products, Social VR platforms. Hastened by the closure and general failings of the once-open source High Fidelity platform, we are now in desperate need of open source alternatives to the growing number of closed source VR-compatible walled gardens in development.\nWe are at the pinnacle of a new wave of VR and related tech, and with the impending maturity of open game engines, audio and video codecs, combined with faster internet connectivity capable of hosting services, and increasingly available VR hardware, the time is right to lead the development of an open platform.\nWe believe in putting power back in the hands of individuals, and thus we are strong believers in decentralized technology. Our initial goal will be to produce a polished, well-functioning service, but we also have plans to integrate decentralized authentication and encryption schemes, including GPG and web of trust based E2EE, as well as decentralized content distribution tech such as Bittorrent and IPFS.\nWho are your users or potential users?\nWe are building a product for all users of social VR, online collaboration or communication products. Social VR is a growing space, and its potential is only beginning to be realized, with a mass movement towards virtual collaboration.\nEven VR as a whole is still in very early stages, but it represents a large potential market, especially with the recent availability of affordable and easy to install headsets such as the Oculus Quest, which has seen rapid growth after its release one year ago.\nAn example of a leading VR platform with public numbers, VRChat has recently between 12000 and 15000 concurrent online users across VR and Desktop platforms, with roughly 4000 concurrent VR users using this platform (out of a reported 4 million registered users as of 2019).\nWhat is your personal connection to the service & the user group you are planning to reach with your product? *\nWe’re a passionate team of VR enthusiasts, some of us tinkering in our spare time with visual effects, level design, or graphics concepts still in research.\nIn an age where collaborating and connecting at distance is increasingly important, meeting in real life can often be a barrier to people. VR has the potential to bring people together and immerse them in a shared space, in a way that not even the best video collaboration can. I and another member of our group have participated in Virtual Market 4, the most recent iteration of a Japanese-run exponentially-growing marketplace of virtual content spanning multiple platforms.\nOther Social VR platforms have found ways to immerse me in a multitude of realities: for example, engaging in real time with people around the world at all times of day and night: attending live dance and music events, seeing performers breakdance and do pole acrobatics using VIVE full body trackers, forming friendships through exchanging personal stories around a campfire, programming environments defined by a math function and then experiencing them in VR, even solving a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle with friends. It is my dream to enable these experiences and more in a setting that is sustainable, open and accessible.\nIf we do not fund this project, will your team still work on it? To what extent? *\nAn Injection of capital by Mozilla will speed up our development and let me take leave of my company to focus full time on the MVP. This could give us the opportunity to outrun these walled gardens in a very short time.\nIf not funded, we will be able to continue to advance it more slowly in our spare time, but other closed platforms are catching up, and time is of the essence. Our project will additionally drive development around open source VR support and 3D tools, and we can see lasting effects from our contributions in those areas.\nWhy did you pick this idea? Do you have domain expertise? How do you know people need what you’re building? *\nWe’re seeding the beginning of the VR frontier, and we already see a sizable fraction of the current VR population spending a substantial amount of time in Social VR walled gardens, such as VRChat.\nIt can be difficult or impossible to build atop walled garden platforms outside of their respective visions: we’ve run into such roadblocks in past projects. For example a combination of lack of the persistence, access to media/web requests, and general customizability has made other platforms unsuitable for building long games, and unsuitable for building complex collaboration tools. Meanwhile, our platform can be self hosted, allows private usage and can be modified.\nOur team includes significant backend and operations experience and several years of work on Godot Engine, all of which will be relevant to building this platform.\nWe suspect the need exists for an open alternative to other competing walled gardens. While many VR platforms are currently free-to-use and advertise a minimal set of privacy features, there is no guarantee that popular platforms will remain free or private forever: for example, a widely used product could be acquired by a corporation with different goals.\nAdditionally, we see potential for a customizable, open platform to be used within enterprises, as well as to build the foundation for games or other content which share needs with our platform, such as its VOIP or VR interaction features.\nAre you looking for any teammates? If so, please indicate what skills or roles you seek.\nNot at this time\nWe have created a Slack Channel and GitHub repository and issues list where you can post your project and look for teammates. You can also pivot or abandon your project as you connect with teammates:\nGitHub: https://github.com/fix-the-internet/spring-mvp-lab/issues\nSlack: https://join.slack.com/t/mozillabuilders/shared_invite/zt-czo6bp37-R9I5mKJVYPtCkTQFu1NLWw\nDescribe your work plan.\nTHIS IS A COPY OF OUR GANTT CHART. THIS WAS NOT SUBMITTED ~Lyuma\nWeek 1: Maintain continuous integration of Windows SteamVR and Oculus Quest, and Linux server builds running on a public server against which to test and dogfood the product. VOIP implementation: basic lipsync based on volume, integrate spatialization library. Improve Inverse Kinematics implementation and add non-VR support.\nWeek 2: Headless clients to extensively stress test the system. Implement crash reporting system, and reporting metrics including performance. Content: Use a basic scripting API to implement physics based games. Begin work on engine changes necessary to give smooth framerates even when during content loading.\nWeek 3: Networking interpolation: eliminate stuttering caused by networking. Godot OpenVR Plugin: fix bugs causing inconsistent framerate in VR. Pre-load content where needed to avoid stutters in the 3d environment.\nWeek 4: Content: Begin work on specific set of hardcoded avatars. Content: Recruit artist to begin work on create default home map. Physics: fix physics errors such as sliding down ramps. Test performance on regular vr hardware and optimization.\nWeek 5-6: Account system, TOS, Privacy Policy. Allow closed registration of users, starting with people who have already shown interest. Continue working on content. Fix bugs and issues as needed. Integration of video playback. Focus on stress testing.\nWeek 7-8 Fix bugs discovered during testing. Monitor performance metrics captured by users, keep fixing performance\nDescribe the approach the team will take to develop the Minimum Viable Product throughout the summer. This includes, but not limited to:\n\nWho are your competitors?\n\nVRChat, Facebook Horizon, RecRoom, AltSpace, EngageVR, Spatial (quest), Mozilla Hubs, VirtualCast, cluster, Sansar, HTC Vive Sync, OasisVR, ChilloutVR, Lavender, Roblox VR (We are not considering non-VR capable platforms or MMORPGs as competition)\n\nHow will you attract your first 1000 users? Your first 1,000,000?\n\nWe anticipate contacts from our immediate VR communities who have already shown interest in our project will seed the first 50 users.\nAt a minimum, we will provide the real time presence features available in other VR platforms: appearing in a room of people who you can hear and to break past 100 users, we will need to provide experiences which are not easily accessible on other platforms such as VRChat.\nTo move beyond thousands of users: being a neutral, open platform to host events: for example, Virtual Market had on the order of a million visitors ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLX7UNKV1fk ; https://v-market.work/ ), was hosted just as a collection of VRChat world instances, and still had to deal with several glitches as a result of instabilities of the underlying platform.\nAnother source of usage will be business meetings, and anything where privacy and self-hosting is a concern. Making sure that it is lightweight and remains very easy to compile will allow novel usages and customizations of the platform.\n\nFirst 2 week development milestone\n\nFirst two weeks:\n\nMaintain continuous integration of Windows SteamVR and Oculus Quest, and Linux server builds running on a public server against which to test and dogfood the product.\nVOIP implementation: basic lipsync based on volume, integrate spatialization library.\nImprove Inverse Kinematics implementation and add non-VR support.\nHeadless clients to extensively stress test the system.\nImplement crash reporting system, and reporting metrics including performance.\nContent: Use a basic scripting API to implement physics based games.\nBegin work on engine changes necessary to give smooth framerates even when during content loading.\nTech stack you plan to use (Cloud services, APIs, mobile platforms, languages, etc)\n\nGodot Engine, k3s, Elixir, OAuth, CockroachDB, nginx, Fedora, CentOS 8, Digital Ocean Spaces, Oculus Quest SDK on Android, Valve OpenVR on Windows.\n\nLink to simple sketches (can be as simple as paper and pencil) of your product or idea\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/659137056991346708/718332831687901224/vsekai-sketch.png\nLinks to mockups, prototypes, pitches.\nWhat challenges do you anticipate with this idea?\nWith the exception of Hubs, the now-defunct High Fidelity, and a handful of proprietary VR platforms, most Social VR applications are being developed in Unity. This leads to a design challenge in building around infrastructure and content that was created specifically with Unity in mind. For example, one of the leading open model sharing formats VRM only officially supports exporting from Unity.\nSocial platforms are strongly impacted by network effect, which puts a challenge towards acquisition. On top of this, VR applications tend to have extremely low retention compared with conventional applications. One possible reason is the restriction of only running one application at a time.\nWe are likely to encounter several unanticipated engineering challenges: VR platforms combine most of the hardest problems in all aspects of computing, from art, networking, social features to graphics optimization.\nTeam Member Locations by Country\nAdd location of all team members by country. COMMA SEPARATED.\nCanada, United States, United Kingdom\nTeam Details\nDescribe the background of ALL team members including finished projects, design skills, technologies, languages + frameworks you are familiar with or briefly describe any professional experience.\nMMMaellon: C++, Java, and Python.

    "section": "",
    "text": "V-Sekai aims to provide a versatile platform for creating and experiencing virtual worlds. Character creation is a crucial aspect of this process, and concept art plays a vital role in visualizing and refining character designs before 3D modeling. This proposal focuses on integrating Easy Diffusion, Windows 11 tools, and Shoebox to streamline this workflow.\n\n\n\nGenerating high-quality, 3D-ready concept art often requires significant artistic skill and time. While AI art generators like Stable Diffusion, particularly with the FLUX model, can expedite this process, setting it up and ensuring the generated art is compatible with 3D modeling tools requires technical expertise and careful optimization. This proposal aims to simplify this process further by incorporating readily available Windows tools.\n\n\n\nThis proposal outlines a workflow using Easy Diffusion for generating concept art, Windows 11 tools for image editing, and Shoebox for sprite creation, ultimately optimizing the process for 3D character creation in V-Sekai.\n\n\nEasy Diffusion provides a user-friendly interface for Stable Diffusion. We will use it with the FLUX model for generating character concepts.\n\nInstall Easy Diffusion.\nUse Beta\nUse 3.5 engine\nDownload the FLUX model and necessary LoRAs (CharacterDesign-FluxV2).\nConfigure Easy Diffusion with the FLUX model and LoRAs.\nOn settings reload remember to force the random seed option.\n\nconcept_prompt.json\n\n\n\nSettings:\n\nSet the width and height to 1024 pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Removal: Use Krita’s Magic Wand tool to select the main part of the image (the character). Then, inverse the selection and delete the rest, isolating the character from the generated image. This creates a transparent background, crucial for 3D model creation.\n\nCaution: Do not feather the edges because it corrupts the background removal algorithm.\n\nFace Erasure: Use Krita’s brush tools to carefully erase the eyebrows, nose, and mouth. You can use a combination of the Eraser tool and the Brush tool with a skin-tone color to blend seamlessly.\nReasoning for Face Erasure:\n\nFocus on Form: It helps emphasize the character’s overall shape, silhouette, and clothing design without getting distracted by facial features.\nFlexibility for Later: It allows for more freedom when creating the actual face in the 3D modeling stage, providing a blank canvas for the artist.\nAvoiding Uncanny Valley: Sometimes AI-generated faces can fall into the “uncanny valley,” appearing slightly off-putting. Erasing the face avoids this issue.\n\nRefinement (Optional): Utilize other tools in Krita, like the selection tools and eraser, for further refinement if needed.\n\n\n\n\nShoebox (https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) is a free online tool for creating sprite sheets.\n\nUpload the alpha’d image from Krita to Shoebox.\nUtilize Shoebox’s features to cut the image into individual sprites.\nKeep only the sprites that are in different views but in the same consistent 3D shape.\n\n\n\n\nTRELLIS can be used for generating 3D models from the concept art or sprites.\n\nInstall Docker Desktop.\nInstall WSL2 with a compatible Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).\nConfigure Docker Desktop to utilize the WSL2 backend.\nEnsure GPU access is enabled within WSL2.\nExecute TRELLIS within WSL2 using the following command in Powershell:\n\ndocker run -it -p 7860:7860 --gpus all registry.hf.space/jeffreyxiang-trellis:latest python app.py\n\n\n\nThe process emphasizes iterative refinement of the prompt based on results from Shoebox or TRELLIS. This cyclical process ensures the generation of optimized concept art and sprites.\n\n\n\n\nDefine Core Concept: Establish the character’s essential characteristics.\nCraft Optimized Prompt: Create a concise, descriptive prompt using Easy Diffusion.\nGenerate and Evaluate: Produce images and assess their suitability.\nRemove Background: Use Krita to remove the background.\nErase Face: Use the Grounded-SAM model to identify and remove facial features (eyebrows, nose, mouth) and paint the area skin color.\nCreate Sprites: Utilize Shoebox to generate sprites from the alpha’d image.\n(Optional) 3D Conversion: Utilize TRELLIS to generate 3D models.\nIterate and Refine: Adjust the prompt based on the evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Image Generation and Preparation\n\nInstall Easy Diffusion: This will be your primary AI art generation tool.\nUse Beta and 3.5 Engine: Ensure you’re using the latest version of Easy Diffusion with the most up-to-date Stable Diffusion engine.\nDownload FLUX Model and LoRAs: Get the FLUX model and the CharacterDesign-FluxV2 LoRA for optimal character generation.\nConfigure Easy Diffusion: Set up Easy Diffusion with the FLUX model, LoRAs, and 2048x1024 pixel resolution.\nGenerate A-Pose Image: Use prompts in Easy Diffusion that specifically emphasize a clear A-pose with the palms facing forward or slightly angled outwards. Include details like:\n\n“A-pose”\n“palms facing forward” (or “slightly outwards”)\n“symmetrical pose”\n“well-defined hands”\nAny specific style or details from your concept art\n\nRefine in Krita:\n\nUse the Magic Wand tool to remove the background.\nUse the Grounded-SAM model to identify and remove facial features, then paint the area skin color.\nUse brush tools to clean up any artifacts or unwanted details. Pay close attention to the hands and fingers.\n\nUse pinokiofactory/clarity-refiners-ui to get the description of the model.\n\n2. Sprite Creation and Rigging\n\nUpload to Shoebox: Import the cleaned image into Shoebox.\nGenerate Sprites: Use Shoebox to create sprites from your image.\nVerify Finger Generation: Ensure all 5 fingers are clearly generated and separated in the sprites.\nConfirm A-Pose: Double-check that the avatar maintains a perfect A-pose throughout the sprite generation process.\n\n3. Advanced Setup (Optional)\n\nInstall Docker Desktop, WSL2, and Configure: If you need more advanced features or prefer a Linux environment, consider setting up Docker Desktop with WSL2.\nExecute TRELLIS in WSL2: TRELLIS can potentially offer more advanced rigging options if needed.\n\nImportant Notes for Palm and A-Pose:\n\nPrompt Engineering: Carefully craft your prompts in Easy Diffusion to get the desired A-pose and hand orientation. Experiment with different keywords and phrases.\nIteration: You might need to generate multiple images and refine them in Krita until you achieve a perfect A-pose with well-defined palms and fingers.\nShoebox Settings: Explore Shoebox’s settings to fine-tune sprite generation and ensure it preserves the A-pose and hand details.\nAlternative Tools: If Shoebox doesn’t meet your needs, consider other sprite generation or 3D modeling tools that might offer more control over rigging and posing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplified Workflow: Streamlines concept art and sprite creation using accessible tools.\nReduced Manual Effort: Minimizes image editing and sprite creation time.\nFaster Iteration: Accelerates character design exploration.\nStandardized Output: Maintains consistency in character presentation.\nAccessibility: Empowers users with varying artistic skills to contribute.\nCost-effective: Leverages free tools readily available on Windows 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nFLUX.1 Style: Inherits the distinctive style of the FLUX.1 model.\nShoebox Limitations: May require manual adjustments for complex sprites.\nTRELLIS Limitations (Optional): Complex elements may still require manual 3D refinement.\nWSL2 Setup (Optional): Requires users to install and configure WSL2 for TRELLIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nManual creation of concept art: Offers greater control but is time-consuming.\nUsing alternative AI models: Other models may not be as compatible with TRELLIS or as user-friendly.\nDedicated Sprite Editors: Can be more powerful but less accessible than Shoebox.\n\n\n\n\nFor highly specific or complex concept art and sprites, manual creation or a combination of AI generation and human artistry may be necessary.

As the world becomes more interconnected, the ability to manage and control various devices remotely has become crucial.\n\n\n\nSoftware that can log into multiple devices, providing users with the ability to perform tasks on those devices without physical access.\n\n\n\nAccording to AlternativeTo, mRemoteNG is a popular open-source alternative to MobaXterm. It’s a fork of mRemote, an open source, tabbed, multi-protocol, remote connections manager.\nKey points:\n\nmRemoteNG is the most popular Windows alternative to MobaXterm.\nmRemoteNG is the most popular Open Source & free alternative to MobaXterm.\n\n\n\n\nThe upside of using mRemoteNG is its versatility and cost-effectiveness. Being an open-source tool, it allows for customization and improvements from the user community. It also supports multiple protocols for managing remote connections.\n\n\n\nThe downside could be the potential learning curve associated with using a new tool. Additionally, as it is open-source, support might not be as readily available or comprehensive as with commercial software.\n\n\n\nThe road not taken would be sticking with traditional, possibly proprietary, terminal emulators.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nMeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.\n\n\n\nAdapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain is a challenge. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.\n\n\n\nThe MeshRWKV model employs a sequence-based approach that autoregressively generates triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two primary steps:\n\n\nThe initial step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This enables the encoding and decoding of triangles from this embedding.\nA graph convolution encoder, specifically a series of SAGE-Conv graph convolution layers, is utilized in this process. This encoder processes the mesh in the form of a face graph. For each graph node, input features include the positionally encoded 9 coordinates of the face triangle, its area, the angles between its edges, and the normal of the face.\nThese geometrically rich features capture the intricate details of 3D shapes and are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization. This effectively reduces the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.\nThese embeddings are then sequenced and decoded by a 1D ResNet-34 network, which interprets the face features as a 1D sequence. It outputs logits corresponding to the 9 discrete coordinates of each face triangle. The size of the codebook C and the discretization space are determined based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.\nOnce trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.\n\n\n\nMeshGPT has made significant strides in the field of direct mesh generation, but it is not without its limitations. The autoregressive nature of the model results in slower sampling performance, with mesh generation times ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. The MeshGPT team’s learned tokenization approach has been successful in reducing sequence lengths for single object generation, but it may not be as effective when applied to scene-scale generation. This presents an opportunity for future enhancement.\nFurthermore, MeshGPT’s current computational resources restrict it to using the GPT2-medium transformer, which is less sophisticated than models like Llama2. Given that larger language models tend to benefit from increased data and computational power, expanding these resources could significantly enhance MeshGPT’s performance and capabilities.\nIt’s important to note that the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model’s context size is significantly larger than that of GPT2. In machine learning, context size refers to the amount of information from previous steps that a model can consider while making predictions for the next step. It essentially determines how much ‘memory’ the model has about past data.\nThe larger context size of RWKV means that it can remember and utilize more past information while generating outputs. This feature potentially enables it to handle larger and more complex tasks, provided there are sufficient computational resources.\nHowever, a larger context size also implies higher computational demands. More processing power and memory are required to store and manage such large amounts of data. This could pose challenges in terms of hardware requirements and efficiency, particularly when dealing with very large datasets or complex tasks.\n\n\n\n\nOur approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.\n\n\n\nGiven that the MeshGPT model has already developed a process for converting mesh data into logits, this simplifies the task of applying the MeshRWKV model to skeletal animation.\nThe fundamental concept would involve representing a sequence of animation frames (from frame0 to frameN) as meshes. The recursive nature of RWKV could potentially offer significant advantages in this scenario. It might facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of sequential frames, which could lead to the generation of smooth and coherent animations.\nWith the mesh-to-logits conversion challenge addressed by MeshGPT, the primary focus can be on developing new training methodologies and loss functions tailored for animation data. This approach could significantly broaden the applicability of the MeshRWKV model, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and development in the field of 3D animation.\n\n\n\nTraining the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.\n\n\n\nOther methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.\n\n\n\nGenerating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nYes, this proposal is core to our work at V-Sekai and will be implemented by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game\nMeshGPT\nObjaverse-XL\nNous-Hermes-2-Vision\nMachine Learning in Elixir\nPyTorch Geometric SAGEConv\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs\n\nAssisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "text": "The MeshRWKV model employs a sequence-based approach that autoregressively generates triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two primary steps:\n\n\nThe initial step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This enables the encoding and decoding of triangles from this embedding.\nA graph convolution encoder, specifically a series of SAGE-Conv graph convolution layers, is utilized in this process. This encoder processes the mesh in the form of a face graph. For each graph node, input features include the positionally encoded 9 coordinates of the face triangle, its area, the angles between its edges, and the normal of the face.\nThese geometrically rich features capture the intricate details of 3D shapes and are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization. This effectively reduces the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.\nThese embeddings are then sequenced and decoded by a 1D ResNet-34 network, which interprets the face features as a 1D sequence. It outputs logits corresponding to the 9 discrete coordinates of each face triangle. The size of the codebook C and the discretization space are determined based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.\nOnce trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.\n\n\n\nMeshGPT has made significant strides in the field of direct mesh generation, but it is not without its limitations. The autoregressive nature of the model results in slower sampling performance, with mesh generation times ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. The MeshGPT team’s learned tokenization approach has been successful in reducing sequence lengths for single object generation, but it may not be as effective when applied to scene-scale generation. This presents an opportunity for future enhancement.\nFurthermore, MeshGPT’s current computational resources restrict it to using the GPT2-medium transformer, which is less sophisticated than models like Llama2. Given that larger language models tend to benefit from increased data and computational power, expanding these resources could significantly enhance MeshGPT’s performance and capabilities.\nIt’s important to note that the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model’s context size is significantly larger than that of GPT2. In machine learning, context size refers to the amount of information from previous steps that a model can consider while making predictions for the next step. It essentially determines how much ‘memory’ the model has about past data.\nThe larger context size of RWKV means that it can remember and utilize more past information while generating outputs. This feature potentially enables it to handle larger and more complex tasks, provided there are sufficient computational resources.\nHowever, a larger context size also implies higher computational demands. More processing power and memory are required to store and manage such large amounts of data. This could pose challenges in terms of hardware requirements and efficiency, particularly when dealing with very large datasets or complex tasks."

    "text": "Given that the MeshGPT model has already developed a process for converting mesh data into logits, this simplifies the task of applying the MeshRWKV model to skeletal animation.\nThe fundamental concept would involve representing a sequence of animation frames (from frame0 to frameN) as meshes. The recursive nature of RWKV could potentially offer significant advantages in this scenario. It might facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of sequential frames, which could lead to the generation of smooth and coherent animations.\nWith the mesh-to-logits conversion challenge addressed by MeshGPT, the primary focus can be on developing new training methodologies and loss functions tailored for animation data. This approach could significantly broaden the applicability of the MeshRWKV model, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and development in the field of 3D animation."

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, Elixir, Membrane Framework, Multiplayer Blender, JSON-RPC\n\n\n\n\nThe current solution for handling multiplayer Blender has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a new approach that leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework. This will involve rewriting the code and introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner.\n\n\nIn this new approach, character posing will be handled in real-time and shared across multiple clients. This means that any changes made to a 3D model by one user will be immediately reflected on all other connected clients. This feature will enhance the collaborative experience and allow users to interact with the same 3D models simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThe state of the world, including objects, lighting, camera position, etc., will also be synchronized across all clients. This ensures that all users are experiencing the same environment, further enhancing the sense of immersion and collaboration.\n\n\n\nWe will introduce procedural generation techniques to create unique and dynamic environments. These generated worlds will be shared across all clients, ensuring that each user’s experience is not only immersive but also unique and engaging.\n\n\n\nAny drawings or annotations made using the Grease Pencil tool will be visible to all clients. This allows for collaborative sketching and planning, making it easier for teams to communicate their ideas visually.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate efficient communication with Blender, we’ll implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner. This will allow us to send commands to Blender and receive responses in a structured and standardized format. This feature will streamline the process of interacting with Blender, making it more efficient and user-friendly.\nBy implementing these features, we aim to improve the scalability and real-time performance of our multiplayer Blender solution. This will lead to a more immersive and collaborative experience for our users.\n\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n  A[Current Code] --&gt; B[Elixir & Membrane Framework Code]\n  C[No Authentication] --&gt; D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]\n  E[No Database] --&gt; F[Khepri Database Library]\n  G[Blender Runner] --&gt; H[JSON-RPC Blender Runner]\n  I[Triangle Only] --&gt; J[Airlocks for Environment Translation]\nThis strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework’s unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on, introduces a JSON-RPC Blender runner for improved communication with Blender, and focuses on the use of triangles (a polygon with 3 vertices) and “Airlocks” for environment translation.\nHere are the key steps:\n\nCodebase: Transition from the current code to Elixir & Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.\nDependencies: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.\nConfig: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.\nBacking Services: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.\nBuild, Release, Run: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir & Membrane Framework Code.\nProcesses: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.\nPort Binding: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.\nConcurrency: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.\nDisposability: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.\nDev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.\nLogs: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.\nAdmin Processes: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.\nBlender Runner: Implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner to facilitate efficient communication with Blender.\nTriangle Only: This principle ensures that only triangles (polygons with 3 vertices) are used in the graphical representation. This simplifies the rendering process and reduces computational complexity.\nAirlocks: Use airlocks to translate the remote environment to the local environment. This allows for seamless interaction between different parts of the system while maintaining isolation and security.\n\n\n\n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, implementing the Khepri database library, introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner, focusing on the use of triangles, and employing the “Airlocks” principles, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance. This will allow for more users to use the system simultaneously without experiencing delays or lags. Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.\n\n\n\nRewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, the Khepri database library, JSON-RPC, the concept of using triangles in graphics, and “Airlocks”.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to optimize the existing code instead of rewriting it.

Once in take 2-3 min to add topics to the left column.\nThen have everyone vote, each person gets 2-3 votes. To vote, they should click the card of a topic to discuss and in the comments type “+”. Be sure nobody else adds any other comments until we begin discussing the cards.\nLast, sort the cards by number of comments (most amount of + go to top) and then one by one drag in the top card to “discussing”. Set a timer for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes the group votes to keep discussing or to move on. While discussing the group can add comments or links to the card while discussing."

    "title": "Draft: Synchronizing Blender and FDB-SQLite for Proxy Movement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Blender is a powerful open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline. On the other hand, FDB-SQLite is a SQL layer built on top of the key-value store FoundationDB. The goal is to synchronize these two systems to proxy movement.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to create a system where movements made in Blender are reflected in the FDB-SQLite database.

    "text": "In software development and maintenance, automation of routine tasks is crucial for efficiency. One such task is launching a database server at system startup. For macOS users, this can be achieved using launchd, an open-source service management framework. In this context, we are specifically interested in automating the launch of the mvsqlite RDBMS server.\n\n\n\nThe task at hand is to create a launchd service for macOS that will automatically run the following command at system startup:\n/usr/local/bin/mvstore --data-plane 127.0.0.1:7000 --admin-api 127.0.0.1:7001 --metadata-prefix mvstore-test --raw-data-prefix m --auto-create-namespace --cluster /usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster\nAdditionally, we need to be able to retrieve logs from this service and check its status.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we can create a .plist file in the ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory. This file will define our launchd service and specify the command it should run. We can also add keys to redirect the standard output and error to log files. Finally, we can use the launchctl list command to check the status of our service.\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n\n\nOpen Terminal and navigate to the LaunchAgents directory:\n\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nCreate a new .plist file called com.user.mvstore.plist:\n\ntouch com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nOpen the file with a text editor (e.g., nano):\n\nnano com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nPaste the following content into the file:\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;com.user.mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;array&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--data-plane&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7000&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--admin-api&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7001&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--metadata-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;mvstore-test&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--raw-data-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;m&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--auto-create-namespace&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/array&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;true/&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;dict&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;RUST_LOG&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;info&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n\nSave and close the file.\nLoad the new service:\n\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.mvstore.plist\n\n\n\nTo retrieve logs from the launchd service, add the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys to the .plist file. These keys will redirect the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to specified log files.\n\n\n\nTo check the launchd status for mvsqlite, use the launchctl list command:\nlaunchctl list | grep mvstore\n\n\n\n\nAutomating tasks with launchd can save time and reduce the risk of errors. It also provides a standardized way to manage services on macOS.\n\n\n\nThe main downside is that launchd is specific to macOS, so this solution won’t work on other operating systems.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach could be to use cron jobs or another task scheduler, but these may not offer the same level of control and flexibility as launchd.\n\n\n\nThis solution is most useful for developers who frequently need to run certain commands at system startup. It may be less relevant for casual users or those who don’t use macOS.\n\n\n\nThis solution was developed in-house by the V-Sekai development team.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\n\nAssistance provided by Aria, an AI assistant."

Finally, we can use the launchctl list command to check the status of our service.\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n\n\nOpen Terminal and navigate to the LaunchAgents directory:\n\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nCreate a new .plist file called com.user.mvstore.plist:\n\ntouch com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nOpen the file with a text editor (e.g., nano):\n\nnano com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nPaste the following content into the file:\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;com.user.mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;array&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--data-plane&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7000&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--admin-api&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7001&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--metadata-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;mvstore-test&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--raw-data-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;m&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--auto-create-namespace&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/array&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;true/&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;dict&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;RUST_LOG&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;info&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n\nSave and close the file.\nLoad the new service:\n\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.mvstore.plist\n\n\n\nTo retrieve logs from the launchd service, add the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys to the .plist file. These keys will redirect the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to specified log files.\n\n\n\nTo check the launchd status for mvsqlite, use the launchctl list command:\nlaunchctl list | grep mvstore"

As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

This includes the ability for users to manipulate objects within the scene and have those changes reflected in real-time for other users connected to the same session. Additionally, seamless integration of new elements into the environment is crucial.\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the features we plan to implement:\n\nReal-time Interaction: Users can move and rotate objects in the scene. Changes appear instantly, providing immediate visual feedback.\nNetworked Synchronization: When one user modifies something, the change is immediately visible to all other users in the same session.\nObject Persistence: Users can save their current scene setup to continue working on it later or retrieve it in another session.\nDynamic Environment Integration: Facilitate the introduction of new interactive elements during live sessions.\nMediator Role: A special user, called a mediator, can manage permissions like who can move what, start or end the session, and oversee interactions between users.\nLimited Scope: Initially, this feature will support multiple users interacting in one scene without additional complexities like handling multiple scenes or advanced physics.\n\nThis upgrade leverages the existing functionality of V-Sekai for uploading and rendering game engine assets.

This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.\nWhen switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.\nYou click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nAble to mask loading times\nAble to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai\nFor style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\ncoordinating cats\nThe drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.\nIt makes for a far less friction-less experience\nBut again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional\nWe could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWorld traversal is a problem.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

The challenge lies in managing the complexity of the model and the computational resources required for training.\n\n\n\nOur approach involves using quad support for the avatars, which allows us to cut the avatar into smaller objects as part of the body. This method is more manageable and efficient than trying to train the model on larger body parts or the entire avatar.\nHowever, it’s important to note that we cannot use triangles and quads at the same time. Also, having a context length of 32k or more will require a bigger model, which might not be feasible unless we have a substantial GPU budget for computation.\nFor our training data, we aim to keep the triangle count below 5k triangles. We also need to consider the shape of the training data and the type of quad data we need to provide.\nIn terms of numbers, we’re looking at around 1500 triangles, which would result in 6k to 9k tokens. If these triangles are converted to quads and there is a reduction, we could aim for around MAX 8k tokens. In this case, 1 triangle equals 6 tokens, and 1 quad equals 8 tokens.\nThis means that 8,000 tokens would equate to 1,000 quads.\n\n\n\n\nTraining the mesh transformer on smaller body parts will make it more manageable and efficient.\nUsing quads instead of triangles could potentially reduce the complexity of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process requires a significant amount of GPU compute power, which could be expensive.\nThe model might not be able to handle large context lengths effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could have chosen to train the model on larger body parts or the entire avatar, but this would require significantly more computational resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach may not be suitable for avatars with complex structures or high polygon counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training of the mesh transformer will be done by us, using our acquired resources and expertise.\n\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\niFire\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game is the GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai Core Team\nTags: Virtual Reality, Rigging, Animation, IK Systems, Development\n\n\n\n\nThe V-Sekai community needs better rigging and animation tools specifically tailored for VR. The goal is to move beyond the current limitations of traditional approaches.\n\n\n\nDevelop an intuitive inverse kinematics (IK) system for VR avatars that removes the need for numerical input, enhancing the user experience.\n\n\n\nThe proposed VR Armature System includes:\n\nHandles designed for VR interaction.\nVisual indicators for joint movement ranges.\nStraightforward adjustment methods without requiring numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle Control Design:\n\nCraft VR-appropriate ergonomic handles.\nTrack VR controller for handle interaction.\n\nVisual Indicator Development:\n\nVisualize joint limits.\nUpdate indicators with joint movement.\n\nIK Solver Integration:\n\nEmploy IK solver for joint positioning.\nValidate across different avatar models.\n\nInterface & Interaction:\n\nInterface design for easy joint manipulation.\nImplement feedback for joint limit reach.\n\nTesting & Debugging:\n\nUser testing for intuitive use.\nRefine system via user feedback.\n\nSystem Finalization:\n\nEstablish final iteration post-testing.\nOptimize for VR performance.\n\nDocumentation & Training:\n\nProduce user guides and tutorials.\nConduct capability and usage training sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing this system aims to improve the creation process in VR and establish V-Sekai as a cutting-edge developer of VR tools.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of a new system may require substantial resources and time for users to become familiar with it.\n\n\n\nOther options, like enhancing existing numerical controls or looking into traditional motion capture technologies, were considered but didn’t meet our immersive needs.\n\n\n\nWhile focused on VR, this system could also benefit animators using more conventional methods by providing improved interfaces and easier rig manipulation.\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial for V-Sekai to maintain this project to ensure it meets our quality standards and integrates seamlessly with our core technologies.\n\n\n\nFor insights into V-Sekai’s contributions to social VR in Godot Engine and our open-source work, please see:\n\nV-Sekai GitHub Repository\nV-Sekai Game Repository\n\nThis proposal was refined with assistance from Aria."

    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,Lyuma,SaracenOne\n\n\n\nFor Groups, this system aims to solve the following issues:\n\n(A) Need a way to standardize scene spawning.\n(B) Need a way to refer to nodes/instances that is consistent across clients (for example, “Set parent to …”).\n(C) Need a way to synchronize state between clients.\n(D) Provides a basic set of standard protocols and interactions.\n(E) Provides the basis for a security/privacy model regarding entity communication/permissions over the network.\n(F) Provides a security model locally for access between nodes of one entity and nodes of another entity (assuming a secure scripting framework is implemented).\n(G) This also solves the problem of abstracting away implementation details of entities; for example, there should be no need to deal with Godot nodes on an individual basis.\n(H) Provide a unified way to create top-level physics hierarchies isolated from other game logic.\n\nNote: This proposal covers three Spawn Types:\n\nSpawn type (i) Entities integrated into a map;\nSpawn type (ii) map entities spawned by clients; and\nSpawn type (iii) avatar entities/props spawned by clients.)\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of:\n\nvehicle games\nbow and arrow games\npickup of balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n\n\nAldridge, David. “I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach”.

    "text": "The increasing need for higher texture resolution on 3D models often necessitates the use of multiple textures, a technique known as UDIMs. This approach, originating from the VFX industry, allows for a single material to utilize multiple texture “tiles” at varying resolutions, providing greater detail and flexibility.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Godot Engine lacks native support for UDIMs, hindering efficient workflows for artists who require high-resolution textures. This limitation forces developers to split materials during modeling or employ workarounds that can be cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n\n\nThis proposal suggests implementing a dedicated UDIM importer and integration within Godot’s material system. The importer would process FBX files containing UDIM information, correctly assigning texture tiles to the corresponding UV coordinates. This would streamline the workflow for artists, enabling them to import and utilize high-resolution textured models seamlessly.\n\nThis tool takes an input FBX file that uses UDIMs by having UVs that are outside the 0-1 range. For example, if a polygon’s UVs are in the range (1-2, 0-1), it’s the UDIM tile 1002 (conceptually one to the right of the main UV space), wheras UVs in the range (0-1, 0-1) are UDIM tile 1001.\nAny polygon UVs which reference UDIM tiles outside 1001 trigger the splitting of the material “Foo” into “Foo_U1001”, “Foo_U1002”, “Foo_U1010” and so on based on the UDIM tile. Polys are then changed to reference the material corresponding to their UDIM tile, and the UVs are adjusted back to the 0-1 range.\nThe tool then writes the result to another FBX file. If you import that FBX into a 3D engine, it will have extra materials from the original, depending on how many UDIM tiles were used. You can then hook up materials to the correct UDIM texture tiles, one per texture, and use the model like normal.\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/fbx-udim-unpack?tab=readme-ov-file#what-this-tool-does from https://github.com/sinbad\n\n\n\n\nImplementing UDIM support offers several advantages:\n\nImproved Artist Workflow: Streamlines the process of importing and working with high-resolution models.\nEnhanced Visual Fidelity: Allows for greater detail and realism in 3D assets.\nIndustry Standard Compatibility: Aligns Godot with industry-standard practices in texture management.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Time and Resources: Requires dedicated effort to implement and integrate UDIM support.\nPotential Performance Impact: May introduce minor performance overhead depending on the implementation.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative solutions, such as manual texture assignment or third-party plugins, were considered less efficient and maintainable compared to native UDIM support.\n\n\n\nWhile UDIMs are becoming increasingly common, simpler projects with lower texture resolution requirements may not necessitate this feature.\n\n\n\nNative UDIM support aligns with Godot’s goal of providing a comprehensive and artist-friendly game development environment.

    "text": "Rigging and clothing fitting are intricate tasks in game development, demanding a deep understanding of 3D modeling, animation, and the specific requirements of the game engine. In the context of V-Sekai, a social VR game built on the Godot Engine, these tasks become even more challenging due to the need for real-time performance and compatibility with various hardware devices.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to provide a solution that enables players and creators to incorporate their own clothing into the V-Sekai game, without turning the game into an impenetrable black box. The current process of rigging and fitting clothing onto characters is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge, limiting the ability of players and creators to fully express themselves through their avatars.\n\n\n\nThe proposed solution involves aligning the vertices from one set of faces to match the vertices in the other set. In Godot, this can be achieved by retrieving mesh arrays and invoking a function with arrays[Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX], arrays[Mesh.ARRAY_INDEX].\nPassing in the Skeleton3D is not necessary. The recently merged API by smix8 allows baking a skeleton to a static mesh, which can be used for baking and then applying the delta.\nWe plan to utilize robust skin weight transfer code and robust Laplacians. The robust Laplacians algorithm is implemented in geometry-central, which loads a mesh, constructs our intrinsic tufted cover, and generates the resulting Laplace (and mass) matrix.\nPlayer creators will have a fully skin-weighted base mesh (a naked character mesh with no clothing). They can then use robust skin weight transfer with a variable distance and the infilling feature to rig their clothing for use in V-Sekai and anywhere that can handle VRM1.\n\n\n\n\nPlayer customization: Our solution empowers players to use their own clothing designs in the game, enhancing their ability to express themselves and engage with the game world.\nEnhanced game experience: By offering more customization options, we can boost player engagement and satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited platform support: Not all platforms support VRM1 for avatars; most only support VRM0. This could restrict the compatibility of our solution with other platforms and games.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to create a set of predefined clothing options within the game itself. However, this would limit the creativity and expression of our players. By enabling them to use their own clothing designs, we are fostering a more vibrant and diverse game community.\n\n\n\nWhile the primary use case is for players to rig and fit their own clothing designs, this solution could also be used by game developers to quickly and easily rig and fit clothing for non-player characters (NPCs). This could save development time and resources.\n\n\n\nThis proposal is core to the functionality of the V-Sekai game and will be implemented by us.

Customize your VRM 1.0 avatar to represent yourself and feel like you’re among friends no matter where they are.\nOur simple spaces provide locations for any activity. You can discuss ideas in a casual lounge, brainstorm on interactive whiteboards, design together in a 3D workshop, or build fully customized environments.\nIn V-Sekai, you can express yourself by sharing and creating things together. You can doodle and prototype on the digital whiteboard or with 3D modeling tools. Bring in images, videos, web content, anything - then combine them into new inventions. You can create alone or with friends to keep improving each other’s work.\nWe know that new platforms need good tutorials. That’s why we make collaborating in V-Sekai simple, with friendly walkthroughs and a helpful community. We built this platform for you, and we listen and update regularly based on what the community wants to create.\nAt V-Sekai, we believe in open access. We are developing ways for outside creators to build new tools, spaces, and features that expand V-Sekai’s potential. We follow our values of empowering users, spreading joy, and helping shape this open world!\nV-Sekai provides space, freedom, and fertile ground for relationships to flourish. The essentials for hanging out with friends in a virtual world are simple enough for everyone yet open for spontaneous interaction and creating together. We build the foundation, and you provide the imagination. Join us in building the future of social VR!\nTo summarize, V-Sekai’s main objectives are:\n• Enabling open communication through voice/text chat and VRM 1.0 avatars\n• Providing simple, flexible spaces for any activity or collaboration\n• Sharing media, tools, and abilities to create together\n• Educating and supporting the community\n• Providing open access for user and creator contributions\n• Fostering human relationships and co-creation in virtual reality\n• Keeping the platform accessible to all while being open-ended enough for creativity\n• Building a foundation for connection focused on user experience\n• Developing an ecosystem where people power imagination and potential."

    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, AI, NPC, Godot 4\n\n\n\n\nIn the realm of game development, creating engaging and dynamic Non-Player Characters (NPCs) is a challenging task. With advancements in AI, there’s an opportunity to leverage these technologies to enhance NPC interactions.\n\n\n\nThe challenge lies in effectively using various AI models to create the “brain” of an AI NPC in Godot 4. This involves generating realistic and contextually appropriate dialogs for the NPCs.\n\n\n\nThe strategy involves using a local GPT4All model for generating AI-based NPC dialog. The script includes several exported variables that can be set in the Godot editor, such as npc_background_directions, sample_npc_question_prompt, and sample_npc_prompt_response. These variables are used to configure the behavior of the AI dialog generation.\nKey functions include:\n\ncall_model(prompt): Calls the local model with a given prompt.\nset_model(new_model_name : String): Sets the model name.\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging AI for NPC dialog generation can lead to more dynamic and engaging gameplay. It allows for a wide range of responses and can adapt to different player inputs.\n\n\n\nAI models require significant computational resources and may not be suitable for all platforms. Additionally, ensuring the appropriateness and quality of generated dialogs can be challenging.\n\n\n\nTraditional methods of NPC dialog generation involve pre-scripted dialogs or simple decision trees. While these methods are less resource-intensive, they lack the dynamism and adaptability of AI-generated dialogs.\n\n\n\nIn games with minimal NPC interactions or where dialog is not a significant aspect of gameplay, the use of AI for dialog generation may not be necessary.\n\n\n\nYes, the implementation of this strategy is done by us in the core of our game development process.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai GitHub\nAI assists this article.\nAxolotl Mistral Example"

To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\nmix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Rejected: Package Godot for pkgin\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nAccording to Netflix, the BSD-type operating systems are competitive, and supporting pkgsrc is an excellent way to start.\n\npkgsrc is a framework for managing third-party software on UNIX-like systems containing over 26,000 packages. It is the default package manager of NetBSD and SmartOS and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n\nV-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEffortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\nWider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\nPromoting cooperation: V-Sekai’s support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\nReinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai’s decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --&gt; B[Build and Package]\nB --&gt; C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --&gt; D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --&gt; E[macOS]\nD --&gt; F[Linux]\nD --&gt; G[NetBSD]\nC --&gt; H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --&gt; J[pkgin command]\nJ --&gt; H\nH --&gt; K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --&gt; I\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\nWide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\nEfficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\nUniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\nConnection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\nResource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai’s VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\nEmphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n\nOption graveyard\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform’s vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"

This setup streams to a Quest 3, which is a virtual reality headset. The system uses portable light houses on clamped sticks for tracking.\n\n\n\nThe challenge lies in integrating the power of the Valve VR ecosystem with the portability of the Quest series. It requires careful selection and arrangement of components to create a mobile VR station that can stream your desktop to your Meta Quest 2 or 3.\n\n\n\nThe strategy involves using 6 HTC or Tundra trackers motion capture. One tracker is dedicated to the continuous calibration with the Meta Quest 3 HMD and the SteamVR ecosystem. Two are used for the foot, two for the shoulders, one for the chest, one for the hips. The setup also includes 2 or 4 light houses and requires the purchase of Virtual Desktop for the Meta Quest 3.\n\n\n\nThe upside of this setup is its portability and versatility. It essentially turns your laptop into a mobile VR station, allowing you to leverage the power of the Valve VR ecosystem anywhere you go.\n\n\n\nThe downside could be the complexity of the setup and the cost of purchasing all the necessary components. However, the benefits of having a portable VR setup may outweigh these drawbacks for many users.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach could be to keep using the tethered VR headset like the Valve Index, but the freedom of being untethered decreases friction to VR use.\n\n\n\nIn addition to regular use, the V-Sekai-faceless repository on GitHub provides a solution for interacting with the virtual world without needing to wear the HMD (Head-Mounted Display). This can be beneficial in various scenarios such as testing or when the HMD is uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.\n\n\n\nThis setup is not part of the core V-Sekai offering but is an innovative idea proposed by members of the community. It demonstrates the potential for creativity and innovation within the V-Sekai ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n[V-Sekai] - AI assists this article.\nOpenVR-SpaceCalibrator\nV-Sekai-faceless"

    "title": "Rejected: Distributed simulation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,networking,\n\n\n\n\nOur project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.\nSomeone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I’m still thinking about that experience.\n\n\n\nWe propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nBy monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.\nWe believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeserver: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.\nSimulation server: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has authority over, including player simulation servers.\nKhepri: A tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and Elixir, used for maintaining a nested path-to-value store.\nRaft cluster: A cluster of servers implementing the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency and fault tolerance.\nOwnership: The player who has control over a game entity and can change its state.\nMastership: The authority that can change ownership rules and default ownership settings.\nAsk, Deny, Allow: Rules set by the Master for ownership transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach type of server can only be Khepri members of the same type.\nEach server can only allow be Khepri members of the same logical instance.\nRaft is only active inside of each logical instance.\nHomeserver servers are REST + JSON and the cheap pattern.\nSimulation servers are using the nasty state transfer pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nAction\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to the home server to fetch the public key of Player B.\n\n\n2\nThe home server retrieves Player B’s public key from its database and sends it back to Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n3\nPlayer A’s simulation server uses Player B’s public key to encrypt a message or binary data.\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s simulation server signs the encrypted message or binary data using its own private key.\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends the encrypted message or binary data along with the digital signature to Player B’s simulation server using the membrane_udp_plugin.\n\n\n6\nPlayer B’s simulation server receives the message and verifies the digital signature using Player A’s public key, which it retrieves from the home server.\n\n\n7\nIf the signature is valid, Player B’s simulation server uses its own private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original data sent by Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n8\nIf the message is confidential, Player B’s simulation server may want to send a response back to Player A’s simulation server using a similar protocol, with Player A’s public key retrieved from the home server.\n\n\n\nThis table outlines the steps of the communication protocol between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers, which involves retrieving public keys from the home server’s database, encrypting and signing messages, and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the messages. This protocol ensures secure and confidential communication between the two simulation servers, allowing for safe and reliable data exchange.\n# EC examples\nalice_private_jwk = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-alice.pem\")\nalice_public_jwk  = JOSE.JWK.to_public(alice_private_jwk)\nbob_private_jwk   = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-bob.pem\")\nbob_public_jwk    = JOSE.JWK.to_public(bob_private_jwk)\n\n## Encrypt and Decrypt (defaults to ECDH-ES with A128GCM)\n### Alice sends Bob a secret message using Bob's public key and Alice's private key\nalice_to_bob = \"For Bob's eyes only.\"\nencrypted = JOSE.JWK.box_encrypt(alice_to_bob, bob_public_jwk, alice_private_jwk)\n### Only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key (Alice's public key is embedded in the JWE header)\n{^alice_to_bob, _} = JOSE.JWK.box_decrypt(encrypted, bob_private_jwk)\n\n\n\nIn a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nMonitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority request to Player B’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s homeserver sends a response to Player A’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority response to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nSending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B’s homeserver without waiting for confirmation.\nTotal hops: 3 + 2 * H\nCase 2: Authority transfer if Player A’s and Player B’s homeservers are exactly the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends a response directly to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nTotal hops: 3\nIn this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation.

Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.

    "text": "VRM is a file format for handling 3D humanoid avatars in VR applications. It’s designed to be a versatile and exchangeable format across various systems. mtoon is a toon shader used with VRM models to give them a distinct, stylized look that emulates 2D animation within a 3D space.\nSubstance Designer is a powerful node-based texturing tool essential for creating realistic textures for 3D models. By implementing mtoon support in Substance Designer, we can bridge the gap between high-quality texture design and VRM character customization.\n\n\n\nThe current workflow for applying toon shading to VRM models is disconnected from the process of designing textures, often requiring multiple tools and manual adjustments. We aim to simplify the workflow by integrating mtoon support directly into Substance Designer, allowing for a more cohesive and efficient design process.\n\n\n\nThe implementation would involve developing a custom Substance Designer node set or a template that encapsulates mtoon’s parameters and replicates its shading model within the Substance Designer environment.

In particular, the dynamic_shapes and simple_embedding samples showcase how to run on your choice of target. The input program may have a signature in the stablehlo dialect, and you can use IREE or XLA depending on your preferred tech stack or runtime requirements. The Vulkan stack in IREE is relatively stable and offers good performance, with nod.ai’s SHARK offering extra tuning and APIs on top.

However, practical limits are imposed by performance considerations. Each UdonSharpBehaviour consumes memory and processing power, so the total number you can effectively use will depend on the complexity of your scripts and the capabilities of the hardware running the world. It’s essential to optimize your scripts and manage resources efficiently to ensure smooth performance.\n\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, UdonSharpBehaviour instances can communicate with each other. Here are some ways they can interact:\n\nCustom Network Events: You can send custom network events (with zero parameters) to trigger actions in other UdonSharpBehaviour instances. The receiver won’t know who the sender is, and the action will be performed locally on the UdonSharpBehaviour’s current frame.\nSynced Variables: If you need to send data, it’s better to use synced variables rather than mixing them with network events. When these variables get updated, the OnDeserialization() method will be called. This is a function in UdonSharpBehaviour that you can override to handle any work needed with the updated variables.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: You typically don’t mix network events with synced variables. If you need to send data, just use synced variables. When the variables get updated, OnDeserialization() will be called. That’s a function in UdonSharpBehaviour that you can override. Do all the work needed with the variables in OnDeserialization.\n\n\n\nAnswer: There’s an advanced feature called FieldChangeCallbacks that allows for code simplification. Basically, create a C# property with a getter and a setter and specify it as the field change callback. The setter will be called in addition to OnDeserialization when network updates come in. This helps combine the code for local and remote clients in the setter. This is an advanced code-writing optimization for making your code cleaner. No, it does not affect performance in terms of space and time. FieldChangeCallbacks reduces code repetition, thereby simplifying the codebase and making it more maintainable.\n\n\n\nAnswer: Assume we calculate the state of the world independently for each frame, without depending on previous frames. This means that while the exact values of the three variables are crucial for determining the current state, the order of changes within the same frame does not affect the final state interpretation at that frame."

However, practical limits are imposed by performance considerations. Each UdonSharpBehaviour consumes memory and processing power, so the total number you can effectively use will depend on the complexity of your scripts and the capabilities of the hardware running the world. It’s essential to optimize your scripts and manage resources efficiently to ensure smooth performance.\n\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, UdonSharpBehaviour instances can communicate with each other. Here are some ways they can interact:\n\nCustom Network Events: You can send custom network events (with zero parameters) to trigger actions in other UdonSharpBehaviour instances. The receiver won’t know who the sender is, and the action will be performed locally on the UdonSharpBehaviour’s current frame.\nSynced Variables: If you need to send data, it’s better to use synced variables rather than mixing them with network events. When these variables get updated, the OnDeserialization() method will be called. This is a function in UdonSharpBehaviour that you can override to handle any work needed with the updated variables.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: You typically don’t mix network events with synced variables. If you need to send data, just use synced variables. When the variables get updated, OnDeserialization() will be called. That’s a function in UdonSharpBehaviour that you can override. Do all the work needed with the variables in OnDeserialization.\n\n\n\nAnswer: There’s an advanced feature called FieldChangeCallbacks that allows for code simplification. Basically, create a C# property with a getter and a setter and specify it as the field change callback. The setter will be called in addition to OnDeserialization when network updates come in. This helps combine the code for local and remote clients in the setter. This is an advanced code-writing optimization for making your code cleaner. No, it does not affect performance in terms of space and time. FieldChangeCallbacks reduces code repetition, thereby simplifying the codebase and making it more maintainable.\n\n\n\nAnswer: Assume we calculate the state of the world independently for each frame, without depending on previous frames. This means that while the exact values of the three variables are crucial for determining the current state, the order of changes within the same frame does not affect the final state interpretation at that frame."

Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nCompile IREE as a C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine 4.0.\nUse the Vulkan backend to run the image superresolution demo.\nLoad and process ML models for image superresolution using IREE.\nIntegrate the resulting functionality into V-Sekai’s existing image processing pipeline.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nAllow image superresolution in V-Sekai.\nEnhanced performance due to IREE’s efficient MLIR-based compiler and runtime.\nScalable solution that adapts to various hardware and software constraints. Not only NVIDIA, but ARM, Intel, AMD and Apple gpus.\nAllow using other machine learning models from PyTorch and Tensorflow\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nAdditional development time required for integration and optimization.\nPotential trade-offs in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse a custom script to work around the image superresolution issue.\n\nThis might not provide a scalable or high-performance solution.\n\nImplement a different image superresolution algorithm.\n\nThis could lead to suboptimal results compared to IREE’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nA custom script could serve as a workaround for infrequent use of image superresolution, but it may have drawbacks in terms of efficiency, output quality, and maintenance efforts. If the feature aligns with V-Sekai’s goals and significantly improves user experience, integrating the IREE-based solution into the core might be more effective.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIn summary, integrating the IREE-based image superresolution feature into V-Sekai’s core offers several benefits, including an enhanced user experience, performance optimization, alignment with open source values, and easier maintenance and support. These advantages contribute to a better, more immersive VR experience while staying true to V-Sekai’s project goals.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nIREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment): https://github.com/openxla/iree\nGodot Engine: https://godotengine.org\nVulkan Backend: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/\nIREE.gd: https://github.com/RechieKho/IREE.gd"

Starting with outlines and simple shapes will make it easier to iterate quickly.\n\n\n\nThe downside could be that focusing too much on the overall shape might lead to neglecting the finer details which are also important in character design. Also, this approach may not work as effectively for complex designs.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach could have been to start with detailed sketches instead of broad shapes. This would allow for more detail early on but could potentially slow down the iteration process.\n\n\n\nThis method might not be suitable if the character design is already well established and does not require significant changes to its overall shape and structure.\n\n\n\nYes, this is a core part of our design process and is done by us.\n\n\n\nFor more information, you can visit the following links:\n\nV-Sekai\nAI assists this article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the vibrant and ever-evolving realm of virtual reality, personal expression is paramount. Users crave the ability to showcase their unique style and personality through their avatars. One powerful avenue for this self-expression is through avatar apparel customization. In this scenario, we’re exploring the creation of a virtual shirt adorned with two distinct patterns. These patterns are applied using SVG files that are converted into a signed distance field mask, ensuring the edges remain crisp and sharp.\n\n\n\nAt present, there’s no straightforward method to design a shirt featuring two different patterns using SVG files in MaterialX, while also maintaining sharp pattern edges. This proposal seeks to address and resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe can harness the power of MaterialX’s shader graph system to craft a custom shader for our shirt. Here’s a rudimentary sketch of how it might be structured:\n# Import MaterialX library\nimport MaterialX as mx\n\n# Create a new document\ndoc = mx.createDocument()\n\n# Create a new shader graph\nshaderGraph = doc.addNode('shadergraph', 'myShaderGraph', 'surfaceshader')\n\n# Add two image nodes for our SVG patterns\npattern1 = shaderGraph.addInput('pattern1', 'filename')\npattern2 = shaderGraph.addInput('pattern2', 'filename')\n\n# Convert SVGs to signed distance fields for sharp edges\nsdfPattern1 = convertSVGToSDF(pattern1)\nsdfPattern2 = convertSVGToSDF(pattern2)\n\n# Add a mix node to blend the two patterns together\nmix = shaderGraph.addNode('mix', 'mix', 'color3')\nmix.setInputValue('fg', sdfPattern1)\nmix.setInputValue('bg', sdfPattern2)\n\n# Connect the mix node to the shader graph output\nshaderGraph.setOutputValue(mix)\nPlease note, this is a simplified example and may require adjustments based on your project’s specific needs.\n\n\n\nImplementing this feature will empower users with additional options for avatar customization. This could potentially boost user engagement and satisfaction. Moreover, by utilizing signed distance fields, we can guarantee sharp pattern edges, enhancing the visual appeal of the shirt.\n\n\n\nThe primary drawback is that this feature could potentially amplify the complexity of the codebase. It may also necessitate additional resources for implementation and ongoing maintenance.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach might involve using a different library or tool that already supports this feature. However, this could potentially introduce other challenges such as compatibility issues or increased project complexity.\n\n\n\nThis feature might not see frequent use if the majority of users favor simpler designs for their avatars’ clothing. Nonetheless, it could still prove beneficial for those desiring more advanced customization options.\n\n\n\nThis feature will be developed by the V-Sekai development team and will form an integral part of our project’s core functionality.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft \n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

This proposal aims to overcome this challenge in the context of V-Sekai projects.\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to create a structured and comprehensive archive of V-Sekai projects that will allow easy access and understanding of each project even years after its completion.\n\n\n\nThe proposed strategy includes:\n\nMaintaining online projects: If a project is hosted online, doesn’t necessitate upkeep and isn’t financially burdensome, it’s best to keep it live for easy future reference.\nStructuring offline projects: For those projects that aren’t feasible to keep online, store them in your local file system. Establish a main folder with yearly subfolders for systematic organization.\nCapturing screenshots: Screenshots serve as a quick visual reference of your project without the need to set it up again.\nCreating screen recordings: For a more comprehensive record, consider creating a screen recording of your project—this not only captures the visual aspect but also records any audio commentary you might provide.\nIncorporating a README: Include a README file that outlines the purpose of the project, its creation and abandonment dates, contributors, and instructions to get it up and running again. This provides essential information about the project at a glance.\nSecuring the database: In cases where projects lack a database dump, all the actual content could be lost. Execute a sqldump or use the export functionality your database offers to create a backup alongside your files. This ensures data preservation.\nRetaining generated assets: When utilizing static site generators, include the directory containing the compiled HTML, CSS & JS in the archive. This allows you to easily browse the complete website by simply running a static file server.\nArchiving on the Internet Archive: If the platform hosting your content isn’t owned by you (for instance, you’re publishing to Discord or Github), consider saving your data to the Archive.org. This adds an extra level of security for preserving your projects.\n\n\n\n\nThis strategy will ensure that all V-Sekai projects are well-documented and easily accessible in the future.

Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users’ input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; D(Combine Variations)\n  B --&gt; E(Base Model)\n  C --&gt; F(Shape Variation)\n  C --&gt; G(Color Variation)\n  C --&gt; H(Texture Variation)\n  F --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  G --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  H --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  E --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  I --&gt; J(Final Output)\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\nUser Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\nSelect Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\nApply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\nCombine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\nGenerate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user’s preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform’s appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEnhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\nUser personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\nEfficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nComplexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\nPerformance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDo nothing.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Draft: VMD on VRM AnimationTree Node\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nEirexe made a VMD player based on Lox’s work.\nThis new ability means we now have a viable way to load VMD motions and use them as a VRM motion player.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe want to make an AnimationTree node to drive Miku Miku VMD motion and add other procedural animation features to blend motion on the VRM Avatar.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nHowever, we need to make some changes to the AnimationTree UI editor to make the changes possible. We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

However, this would not offer the same level of customization and convenience as generating a model from a prompt.\n\n\n\nUsers who require highly detailed and specific 3D models may find the prompt-based generation less useful, as it may not always produce the desired level of detail or accuracy.\n\n\n\nThis proposal involves developing a new feature for our platform, which will be done by our development team.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft \n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - This is the GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\n\nThis proposal was assisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "text": "V-Sekai is committed to enhancing data integrity, optimizing database performance, and standardizing data storage practices. To achieve these goals, we propose the adoption of the Essential Tuple Normalization Form (ETNF) across our database systems.\n\n\n\nCurrently, V-Sekai’s database systems lack a standardized approach to normalization. This leads to data redundancy, inconsistency, and inefficiencies in data management, which can hamper system performance and scalability.\n\n\n\nWe propose implementing ETNF, a normalization form that strikes an optimal balance between eliminating redundancy and maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. Positioned between the fourth normal form (4NF) and the fifth normal form (5NF), ETNF provides a sophisticated yet practical approach to database normalization.\n\n\nA relation schema R is in Essential Tuple Normal Form (ETNF) if every tuple in every instance of R is essential. This means that no tuple in the database can be generated from other tuples, thus eliminating redundancy.\nIn mathematical terms, a relation R is in ETNF if and only if it is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and some component of every explicit join dependency (JD) of R is a superkey. Specifically, for every nontrivial join dependency {R1, R2, …, Rn} that holds over R, the intersection of each pair of Ri and Rj is a superkey for at least one of Ri or Rj.\nThis concept is further illustrated by the theorem stating that if R is a relation schema specified only by functional dependencies (FDs) and join dependencies (JDs), then R is in ETNF if and only if it is in BCNF and some component of every explicit JD of R is a superkey.\nTherefore, ETNF is an effective normalization form that reduces data redundancy while maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. It provides a balance between the elimination of unnecessary redundancy and the avoidance of extensive decomposition associated with higher normal forms like 5NF.\n\n\nConsider a V-Sekai database table storing information about parts, suppliers, and respective shipments. The table is not normalized and contains redundant data.\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\nPartID\nPartName\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP1\nPart1\n100\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP2\nPart2\n200\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP1\nPart1\n150\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP3\nPart3\n300\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\nP2\nPart2\n250\n\n\n\nIn this table, SupplierName and PartName are repeated for each SupplierID and PartID, respectively. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies and anomalies.\n\n\n\nTo normalize the above table into ETNF, we would decompose it into three separate tables: Supplier, Part, and Shipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\n\n\nS2\nBob\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartID\nPartName\n\n\n\n\nP1\nPart1\n\n\nP2\nPart2\n\n\nP3\nPart3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nPartID\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nP1\n100\n\n\nS1\nP2\n200\n\n\nS2\nP1\n150\n\n\nS2\nP3\n300\n\n\nS3\nP2\n250\n\n\n\nIn these normalized tables, each tuple is essential and there is no redundancy. The SupplierName is not repeated for each shipment from the same supplier, and similarly, the PartName is not repeated for each shipment of the same part. This design adheres to the principles of ETNF, enhancing data integrity and consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedundancy Reduction: ETNF effectively reduces data redundancy by ensuring that all data stored in the database is essential and non-repetitive.\nData Integrity and Consistency: By minimizing redundancy, ETNF enhances the integrity and consistency of the database, making data more reliable and accurate.\nBalanced Complexity: ETNF offers a middle ground between 4NF and 5NF, reducing redundancy without the complexity of decomposing relations into smaller, more numerous relations as often required by 5NF.\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency Analysis: The first step involves a detailed analysis of all functional and join dependencies across the database to identify redundancy and determine the scope for normalization to ETNF.\nSchema Evaluation and Restructuring: Evaluate existing database schemas against ETNF criteria, identifying areas where restructuring is required to eliminate redundancy and enhance efficiency.\nPractical Application and Migration: Implement the ETNF principles through schema redesign and careful data migration, ensuring that the transition does not impact data integrity or system availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Data Integrity: Implementation of ETNF will significantly improve the integrity and reliability of V-Sekai’s data.\nOptimized Performance: By reducing redundancy, ETNF will streamline data storage and retrieval processes, enhancing overall system performance.\nStrategic Data Management: Adopting ETNF aligns with strategic initiatives for scalable, efficient, and consistent data management practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nA normal form for preventing redundant tuples in relational databases\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

It’s now time to refresh our goals and direction.\n\n\n\nOur current V-Sekai charter is outdated and needs to be revised to reflect the project’s current state and future ambitions in 2024.\n\n\n\nA one-line summary of the MVP:\nA customizable and self-hosted virtual reality environment built on Godot Engine.\nDescription of the product: What will the MVP be in 8 weeks?\nOur virtual reality app will be compatible with all SteamVR-compatible PC headsets and the Meta Quest VR platform. It will feature a social hub with 3D voice chat, real-time body tracking, simple games, integrated physics, and social video viewing.\nCategory:\n\nDecentralized Web: YES\nMessaging & Social Networking: YES\n\nWhy does your idea matter? How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet or make the internet more awesome?\nThe internet thrives on openness and communication. We believe virtual reality is a powerful new medium for human connection. With the closure of platforms like High Fidelity, open-source alternatives are crucial to counter the trend of closed VR platforms.\nVR technology is advancing rapidly. Better game engines, audio and video codecs, faster internet speeds, and more accessible VR hardware create the perfect opportunity to develop an open platform.\nWe champion individual empowerment through decentralized technology. Our goal is to build a polished and functional service that integrates decentralized authentication and encryption, along with content distribution technologies like BitTorrent and IPFS.\nWho are your users or potential users?\nOur target audience includes users of social VR experiences, online collaboration tools, and communication products. The social VR space is growing, and its potential is just beginning to be explored.\nDespite being a relatively new technology, VR has a large potential market, particularly with the rise of affordable headsets like Meta Quest. For example, VRChat boasts between 12,000 and 15,000 concurrent users, with approximately 4,000 using VR in 2019.\nWhat is your connection to the service & the user group you plan to reach with your product?\nWe are a team of VR enthusiasts with backgrounds in visual effects, level design, and graphics.\nIn an era where remote connection is essential, VR offers a more immersive and engaging way to bring people together compared to traditional video calls. One of our team members has participated in Virtual Market 4, a growing virtual content marketplace.\nThrough other social VR platforms, we have connected with people worldwide, attended live events, and formed meaningful friendships. We aim to provide these experiences in an open and accessible environment.\nWill your team still work on this project if we do not fund it? To what extent?\nWe are committed to this project and will continue development regardless of funding. However, external funding would significantly accelerate our progress and help us stay competitive with closed VR platforms that are rapidly evolving.\nWhy did you pick this idea? Would you happen to have domain expertise? How do you know people need what you’re building?\nWe recognize the need for an open alternative to closed VR platforms.

    "title": "Rejected: RabbitMQ RA vs SQLite on FoundationDB vs CockroachDB",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We are at a critical juncture in our system design process. The primary question is whether to utilize the RabbitMQ RA system for distributed state machines, implement an SQLite cluster database built on top of FoundationDB, or use CockroachDB.\n\n\n\nThe core issue is identifying which options deliver the fastest and most reliable service. We require a system capable of handling high data volumes, maintaining consistency, and ensuring rapid response times, particularly when transferring 3D scene format tiles from Blender or Godot Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbitMQ RA system might be the better choice if speed and low latency are the primary concerns. It’s designed for high-throughput scenarios and can handle many messages without significant delays.\n\n\n\nAn SQLite cluster database on FoundationDB, while also fast, focuses more on providing ACID transactions and scalability.

    "title": "Proposed: Multiplayer Sync Between Different Godot Instances",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We aim to enhance multiplayer capabilities in the Godot Engine by synchronizing node scene trees across different instances.\n\n\n\nCurrently, synchronizing complex node scene trees in multiplayer scenarios within Godot is challenging. There’s a need for an efficient method to ensure consistency across all client instances.\n\n\n\nThe proposal involves implementing a synchronization protocol that mirrors the node scene tree structure across all multiplayer instances. This includes:\n\nSyncing Node Trees: Establishing real-time updates, property synchronization, and state management to ensure all clients reflect the same scene tree.\nfunc sync_scene_tree(node):\n        for child in node.get_children():\n                update_network_properties(child)\n                sync_scene_tree(child)\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal ensures consistency by providing all multiplayer clients with a synchronized view of the scene.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Draft \nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a platform that requires regular configuration of GoCD agents. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors if not done correctly.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to configure the GoCD agents after a restart of the host machine. This involves accessing the GoCD server, navigating to the Agents page, enabling new agents, configuring agent resources, assigning environments, and saving changes.\n\n\n\nThe strategy is to follow a step-by-step guide to ensure that all the necessary configurations are made correctly. This includes:\n\nAccessing the GoCD Server\nNavigating to the Agents Page\nEnabling New Agents\nConfiguring Agent Resources\nAssigning Environments\nSaving Changes\n\n\n\n\nBy following this guide, users can ensure that their GoCD agents are configured correctly and ready to run jobs. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that this process needs to be repeated every time the host machine is restarted.

How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project’s goals and priorities.\n\nHow it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nA well-organized project documentation and visual roadmap will help potential contributors understand the project’s scope and vision, allowing them to make informed decisions about contributing.\nA transparent contribution process will facilitate collaboration by providing guidelines, resources, and communication channels for contributors.\nOnboarding new contributors with tutorials and mentorship will help them quickly become productive and dedicated team members.\nRegular meetings and progress updates will keep the team motivated and focused on achieving milestones.\nRecognizing and rewarding contributors will foster a sense of community and commitment, making it more likely that they continue contributing to the project.\n\nWith these measures in place, the V-Sekai project will overcome its current limitations, making it easier for the team to work together and attract new contributors.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nDevelop a clear and concise project documentation that outlines the project’s goals, requirements, and milestones. Establish a transparent and structured contribution process, including:\n\nCreate a centralized repository for documentation, code, and assets, with clear guidelines for contributing.\nDevelop a project roadmap with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and assigned responsibilities.\nImplement an onboarding process for new contributors, including tutorials, resources, and mentorship.\nOrganize regular meetings and communication channels for updates, progress reports, and collaboration.\nRecognize and reward contributors for their work, fostering a sense of community and commitment.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved collaboration and communication among the team\nAttracting more contributors with diverse skill sets\nFaster progress towards project milestones\nClear understanding of project goals and priorities\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nIncreased management and coordination overhead\nPotential for disagreements on priorities and approaches\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nWhile it may be possible to work around some aspects of the problem with a few lines of script, it would not address the underlying issues of attracting and retaining contributors or improving collaboration. The proposed solution aims to create a more sustainable and efficient environment for the V-Sekai project, which cannot be achieved with a temporary workaround or a simple script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nAs the primary developers of the project, the V-Sekai team has the best understanding of the project’s goals, objectives, and priorities. Implementing this feature in-house will ensure that the solution aligns well with the project’s vision and addresses the specific needs of the project.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nV-Sekai Roadmap and Goals\nV-Sekai Team Discussions and Updates\nMermaid.js"

There’s an apparent need to streamline development processes and ensure reliable automation in build and deployment workflows.\n\n\n\nThe current manual setup of development environments, especially continuous integration (CI) agents, is time-consuming and error-prone. The process lacks documentation, which creates barriers for new contributors and limits the scalability of the existing CI infrastructure.\n\n\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose to document the process thoroughly and automate the setup of GoCD agents, particularly for macOS environments, to facilitate smoother onboarding and reduce setup discrepancies.\n\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide to setting up a GoCD agent service and configuring it to automatically start up on boot on a Mac.\n\n\n\nBoot your freshly reset or newly bought Mac.\nProceed with the initial setup, creating a user account as prompted by the macOS setup wizard.\n\n\n\n\ncd go-agent-20.5.0\nsudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine .\n\n\n\n\nHandle Single Sign-On (SSO) if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in with your Apple ID and download Xcode from the App Store.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Homebrew and the command line developer tools.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GoCD agent via Homebrew or download from the GoCD website.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit wrapper-properties.conf to configure your GoCD server URL and additional preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the server URL to https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/go.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a launch daemon for automatic startup on boot using the following commands:\nsudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.gocd.agent.plist &lt;&lt;EOF\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;com.gocd.agent&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;array&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/Users/fire/go-agent-23.5.0/bin/go-agent&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;start&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/array&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;true/&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;true/&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\nEOF\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.gocd.agent.plist\nsudo launchctl list | grep com.gocd.agent\nReplace /Users/fire/go-agent-23.5.0 with the actual path where the binary resides.\nVerify that the agent starts upon boot.\n\nYour GoCD agent should now automatically start up whenever your Mac boots up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating the setup of the GoCD agents substantially minimizes the potential for human error during configuration. It also speeds up the onboarding process for new developers and maintains consistency across multiple setups.\n\n\n\nThe main downside is the initial investment in time and resources required to document and test the automation scripts. Additionally, there is a reliance on macOS-specific services, which could alienate potential contributors who do not have access to a Mac.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we considered using different CI services, like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, but decided against it due to GoCD’s robustness and flexibility fitting V-Sekai’s needs more closely.\n\n\n\nWe recognize that not all contributors will require a local GoCD agent setup. However, for those involved in CI pipeline management or requiring a mirrored development environment, this will be invaluable.\n\n\n\nThis proposal suggests that the task be managed internally by the core V-Sekai team to maintain control over critical infrastructure components.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub repository for the V-Sekai game.\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

    "text": "In May 2023, significant progress was made in the Godot community and V-Sekai project. Key developments include the implementation of WebAssembly modules for Godot Engine 4, improvements to the V-Sekai Godot Engine fork, and advancements in Unidot’s FBX humanoid support. Additionally, there were updates to the manual site, suggestions for Blender VRM drag-and-drop support, and bug fixes related to LODs.\n\nhttps://github.com/ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/tree/godot-4 Implements wasm modules for Godot Engine 4.\nFire has chatgpt4 api access.\nMerged godot-wasm into V-Sekai Godot Engine fork for experimenting with user generated scripting and optimization of computation.\nvsk_speech branch of V-Sekai Godot Engine passes cicd again!!\nRevised and optimized the manual site.\nSuggested that .VRM drag and drop support is added to Blender. https://github.com/mika-f/blender-drag-and-drop/issues/34#issuecomment-1539429579\nUse a better representation of feminine and masculine avatars\nFixing bugs with lods\n\n\n\nLyuma has been working on implementing imported humanoid FBX support in Unidot, including bone guessing. The current implementation supports FBX source models and performs bone name guessing when humanDescription is empty. However, it does not yet support humanoid .anim clips, and there are known issues applying Animator components to already-imported models.\nAfter fixing a typo in Fix Silhouette, Lyuma reported that FBX humanoid animation import in Unidot seems much closer. They also implemented support for “Copy from other Avatar” to handle conversion of Maya FBX files with the first frame posed like the animation. This allows using the T-pose of another model as the rest pose.\nLyuma shared their progress on Twitter, showcasing the effectiveness of Unidot-Importer by VSekaiOfficial and Godot 4.0’s new humanoid retargeter system. The Godot Engine community also discovered the team’s GLTF work, as seen in a tweet by Bramwell.\nGamefromscratch covered Godot -&gt; Unity migration in a YouTube video, highlighting the use of barcoderdev’s version of FBX2glTF with Unidot, which might solve the pivot issue encountered earlier."

    "text": "In June 2023, various developments and discussions took place in the Godot community, particularly within the V-Sekai project. Key highlights include updates to the godot-vrm repository, security improvements in the v-sekai-game repository, and progress on animation retargeting and PMX character structure. Additionally, a fix was implemented for Skeleton3D’s rest_dirty reset issue.\n\nFork created: aaronfranke/godot-vrm (01/06/2023)\nNew commits in V-Sekai/godot-vrm repository, including updates to load_at_runtime_scene for 4.x and adding files_dropped functionality (02/06/2023)\nPR 130 closed, bumping github/codeql-action from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nPR 129 closed, bumping actions/setup-dotnet from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nStepSecurity bot opened PR 131 to apply security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to avoid the empty avatar crash (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error (02/06/2023)\nNew tag created in V-Sekai/godot: groups-4.x.2023-06-03T034215Z (02/06/2023)\nPR 131 closed, applying security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to make joining a server less crashy (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to remove debug points (02/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: codeql (02/06/2023)\nPR 132 opened, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew comment on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing how to make a VRM model pose using GDScript (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error part 3, avoiding runtime errors, and removing gut (02/06/2023 - 03/06/2023)\nPR 132 closed, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nPR 133 opened, hardening GitHub Actions in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nNew comments on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing animation retargeting and PMX character structure (03/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including removing hardcoded gravity and gravity direction, inverting state machine condition, and setting up work in progress state chart (03/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: state-chart (03/06/2023)\nSkeleton3D now correctly resets rest_dirty only after all bone transforms have been updated (PR 78025 by lyuma). This also resolves the SkeletonGizmo display issue when there is more than one bone root.\n\n\n\nThe team has introduced a feature that allows for easy setup with just a single click. Additionally, they’re now utilizing an advanced system known as the Many Bones’ solver.\n\n\n\nThere were some concerns about how much time the GPU was spending on processing the shader - think of the shader like a set of instructions telling the GPU how to draw each pixel. The frame times, or the speed at which frames are processed, seemed to be slower than expected. However, it was clarified that these tests were being run in a mode designed for finding errors (debug mode), not for optimal performance.\n\n\n\nThe team discussed how their system’s performance stacks up against other virtual reality social platforms. They used different types of hardware for these comparisons, similar to comparing the performance of different cars using various types of roads and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe team also talked about how to best optimize their system for different devices. This is akin to tuning a car’s engine differently depending on whether it’s going to be driven in the city or on a racetrack.\n\n\n\nThere were discussions about the challenges of rendering avatars, especially when there are multiple avatars on the screen at once. It’s like trying to paint multiple portraits at the same time - the more you have, the harder it gets. The team discussed the need for guidelines to help avatar creators optimize their designs for less powerful hardware.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to conduct more tests, particularly focusing on how well their system handles complex 3D models on Android devices. They also aim to create a benchmark scenario where they expect good performance across most platforms, much like setting a standard track to test different cars’ performances."

(We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actually add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints? The glb here should have a spinning diamond and two spinning skinned cubes:” https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845433592888557568/MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3.glb\n\n2021-05-21 22:29:43Z fire: We also gain the ability to post more twitter tweets.\n2021-05-21 22:29:23Z fire: Had a discussion with Lyuma and Saracen about V-Sekai for wider testing and how it was blocked by scene validation feature.\n2021-05-21 15:27:33Z fire: Multiple PRs from fire and Lyuma were merged for gltf problems\n2021-05-20 15:28:19Z fire: トカゲ https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-fire/commits/features/skeleton-gizmos I did some cleanup, rebased on the modification stack and changed the color for selected bones to be a darker orange\n2021-05-20 15:26:43Z fire: Lyuma IK and Modification stack are now a stacked branch.\n2021-05-20 04:21:06Z fire: Work with Lyuma on 3 glTF bug fixes. 1. instead of failing all the meshes only fail once 2. the skins duplication removal code has a bug and it needs to check skin bind bone, skin bind name and pose transform. 3. the skin bind code was removed 4. gltf 4.0 modules was backported to 3.2\n2021-05-19 19:20:41Z fire: Lyuma and I summarized our concerns about the ease of implementation and the inability to use off the shelf code.\n2021-05-19 19:20:00Z fire: OMI Week 3.

There’s also a microsoft and a mozilla hub implementation for spatial audio node in wav?, mp3? or ogg? . He had unfinished business with the extension namespace of hubs and wanted to split it.\n2021-06-23 00:19:33Z lyuma: “https://github.com/V-Sekai-godot-hop-spin-dance Don’t get your hopes up quite yet: A lot of the lower level dependencies for scene packing and t-posing are not converted yet, but the tool scripts work now, so it’s a start :-p” 🔥 (1)\n2021-06-23 00:19:07Z lyuma: Worked with fire to get the avatar conversion tool updated, using the high level vsk_avatar vsk_vrm_avatar_tool modules: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/857052116593803284/unknown.png\n2021-06-22 23:48:06Z lyuma: mux says they also keep hitting this issue. they also made the connection to set_name() interestingly\n2021-06-22 23:47:51Z lyuma: after a day of debugging, Saracen got a reproduction project here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49843\n2021-06-22 23:22:17Z fire: Another day. Implement vrm quaternion format from lox9973 from ShaderMotion to move godot VRMs\n2021-06-22 21:00:23Z fire: We ported the avatar T-Poser to the point the menu popup shows and checkpointed, then concluded for lunch. Multiple modules were ported.\n2021-06-22 20:56:35Z fire: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2903 Lyuma wrote a proposal\n2021-06-22 17:33:46Z fire: “Did a 5 minute design for libcurl in Godot Engine.

A vs B cs C https://imgsli.com/NTgzMDk/1/2\n2021-06-21 12:40:26Z fire: Good news, the gd_util, math_util and vsk_avatar plugin enables. Now to test it.\n2021-06-21 03:30:21Z fire: Updated godot-vrm to latest master. https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm/tree/master 👍 (1)\n2021-06-20 23:44:26Z Saracen: More fixes to be compatible with the latest master branch. Also making more bug reports for serious issues I encounter 🐛 (1),👍 (1)\n2021-06-20 20:29:37Z fire: It’s pretty slow like 7 seconds\n2021-06-20 20:29:23Z fire: &gt; RGBA Max error: 77 RMSE: 1.55 PSNR 44.34 dB\n2021-06-20 20:29:22Z fire: # bc7_enc_rdo\n2021-06-20 20:29:01Z Saracen: Wow, the existing one is already pretty fast.

It was a badly ported coroutine calling a heavy function continually. Still some issues with pathfinding and abilities not executing, but it’s at least actually functioning now.\n2021-06-19 19:22:18Z Saracen: Further fixes, there’s workarounds now for the tool I wrote to extract root motion. Two of the notable bugs I’ve discovered are ConfigFile.load returning random values and the fact that there doesn’t seem to be implicit casting between String and StringName. Want to create some example projects for this. It’s also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it’s running OBSCENELY slow at the moment. 🦥 (1)\n2021-06-19 18:01:49Z Saracen: Some more progress on the Amethyst port\n2021-06-19 07:45:39Z fire: Can now export blends to gltf2 and save as an artifact.

It’s amazing how many different ways there are to fix bit operations on a single line of code\n2021-06-11 03:45:26Z lyuma: Updated shader_improvements_meta_3.x branch for latest 3.x godot so someone could try SCSS (I want to keep it for historical purposes). I’m not going to update 4.x because it’s in flux and too much churn with renames to keep anything working\n2021-06-11 03:44:54Z lyuma: Found a bug in MToon, related to a line of code that flips the normal if it’s pointing backwards from the view direction (you can see this if you look at an MToon face with custom normals from a sharp direction).\n2021-06-10 22:56:30Z fire: Restoring the CICD builds for godot 4.

This is is the important part. I can now start a github action, start a kubernetes server, start a argo server, start an alpine linux image, have a whale message a hello world and then save it as a file and have it be download as a github artifact\n2021-06-09 20:50:29Z lyuma: “I tried baking lighting in the”“AirBNB”” and ran into this error: &gt; WARNING: Inconsistency found in triangulation while building BSP, probe interpolation quality may degrade a bit. &gt; at: LightmapGI::_compute_bsp_tree (scene\\3d_gi.cpp:460) &gt; &gt; Jfons informed me it is an issue with separating tetrahedrons.

There were bugs reading the scale, but now that is fixed and the issue with losing polygons will only happen on triangles with 1e-7 edge length in world space.\n\nThe issue with removing mesh edges still exists, in theory, but in practice it seems unlikely so let’s wait and see if it shows up in the wild and then we can take another look”\n\n2021-06-09 18:09:18Z lyuma: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/852248004215570432/unknown.png\n2021-06-09 18:07:18Z lyuma: Due to a glitch in Godot’s etcpak implementation, I had to use BPTC texture compression.

Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else.\n\n\n\n\nRestore fix-save-as-binary so we can export projects\nRestore elixir shared branch so we can run godot in elixir\nPoked ludwig about diffusion net for machine learning training.\n\n\n\n\nFBX2GLTF and Blender importers are merged.\n\n\n\niFire\n\nMade a bug report for Blender exported animation to gltf with @RockyMadio https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1613 GitHub"

Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else."

In that case, it feels like WebRTC may jump past firewalls easier, and there’s existing turn-ice stuff.\nMy colleague noted that you could have one Godot engine server provide a proxy to another Godot server. The design was similar to cell phone vs cell phone tower vs tower to tower distribution of messages. It wasn’t clear that was possible, but he found something. Any thoughts about that?\n\n\nProblems\nWebRTC is much more complex to set up, so I don’t think it is a good alternative for ENet for indies.\nWebRTC needs infrastructure; ENet does not.\nDependency problems between ScriptInstance and PacketPeer. What do you mean?\nThe script_language.h includes packet_peer.h, so PacketPeer cannot use GDVIRTUAL because that needs script_language.h\n\nQuestions\nHow do modern games different games have different bandwidth minimums?\nCents per hour to host how many players?\nHole-punching for pure peer-to-peer games.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is compiled into the project and is work to change.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nNetworking is part of the project and can’t be changed by mods.\n\n\nReferences\nNo response\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this.

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one.

    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, VR, Game Development\n\n\n\n\nWe have identified a limitation in the V-Sekai platform where there are too many variables to pose the kusudama constraints on the desktop. We propose to overcome this limitation by introducing a VR mode.\n\n\n\nOur solution involves creating a VR mode specifically for posing Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. The steps for implementation are as follows:\n\nTake an off the shelf VR controller.\nTake an off the shelf multiplayer functionality.\nDevelop a tool selection ui. Collaborate with guillefix.\nAdjust the kusudama constraint attributes to match posing.\nSave attributes.\n\n\n\nImagine you have a ball. There are two ways you can move it:\n\nTwist: Like spinning a globe on its stand.\nSwing: Like moving your finger from one spot to another on the ball.\n\nThink of a Kusudama (a type of origami that forms a sphere) as an example for the swing movement. The pieces of paper move just like your finger would on the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate Saracen’s VR networking prototype.\nRebuild character posing without tracking the physical sensors\nApply Many Bone IK tracking\nRotation swing (10x Vector4)\nRotation twist (From and range)\nAdjust for quality\nComplete configuration\n\nAssigning physical sensors to IK points is non-goal.\n\n\n\n\nDesktop Mode Enhancement: Initially, we considered enhancing the desktop mode to handle the kusudama constraints better. However, this option was discarded due to the inherent limitations of the desktop interface for such complex interactions.\nUse of External Tools: Another option was to use external tools or plugins specifically designed for handling Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. This option was rejected because it would require users to learn and manage additional software, which could lead to a fragmented user experience.\nSimplified Kusudama Constraints: We also thought about simplifying the kusudama constraints to make them more manageable on the desktop. But this option was discarded as it would limit the capabilities and flexibility that our platform currently offers.\nAutomated Posing: An automated system for posing the kusudama constraints was also considered. However, this option was rejected because it would take away control from the users, potentially leading to less satisfactory results.\nTutorials and Guides: Providing extensive tutorials and guides to help users navigate the complexity of posing kusudama constraints on the desktop was another option. This was discarded because it doesn’t address the core issue - the difficulty of managing these constraints on a desktop interface.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased complexity in game development.\nPotential need for more resources (time, manpower, etc.) for implementation and testing.\n\n\n\n\nThis section is reserved for options considered but rejected.\n\n\n\nPosing the avatar is the first interaction a user has when entering our virtual world, V-Sekai. This underlines the necessity of investing in this enhancement to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience right from their first interaction with our platform.\n\n\n\nPose quality is crucial to us. As the creators of V-Sekai, we have an unparalleled understanding of our platform’s limitations and potential improvements. This insight puts us in a unique position to enhance the pose quality in a way that aligns with our users’ needs and expectations. Therefore, it is essential that we undertake this enhancement.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

Vargrant is not the status quo.\n\nProxying\nSome udp based proxying methods are known\n\nhttps://github.com/yyyar/gobetween for standalone\ncillium for kubernetes\nWebRTC ice, stun, turn\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nV-Sekai Developers\nWe package V-Sekai in Soiree party mode.\n\nWe start a single server of CockroachDB SQL database and not the default 3 server mode.\nWe provide installs of the Godot game engine client and server.\nWe re-arrange our elixir application Uro to work as a Sandstorm.io application.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai Packages\n\nV-Sekai provides a Server Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Client Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Uro Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\n\nThere is an open question if V-Sekai sandbox design works with powerbox.\n\n\nPlayer and Hosts\n\nIndividual hosts of Sandstorm.io can start their own grains of V-Sekai in Soiree mode.\nPlayers download the Godot Engine client and play.\n\n\n\nHosts\n\nMust provide a way to access the Godot Engine server and the Sandstorm server.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt is not trivial and not a few lines to implement a distributed system for a developer.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nSelf-hosted is a feature.\nWe can use Soiree Party mode to test V-Sekai.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nMaybe too complicated for the developers.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are investigating how to implement the Soiree Party mode.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/powerbox/\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/services/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm\nhttps://github.com/mrmetaverse/soiree\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Instead of a lens, we aim to generate an overlay using the mesh’s primitive outline. Similar to the multi-tool interface in Half-Life: Alyx, the tool will surface entity details as a holographic overlay.\n\n\n\nHow can we generate a holographic overlay by utilizing a list of triangle edges extracted from mesh data?\n\n\n\nThe proposal involves parsing the mesh data to extract triangle edges and rendering these edges as a holographic overlay. Utilizing a compatible rendering engine, each edge will be transformed into visible lines with appropriate shading and anti-aliasing. The system will dynamically update the hologram in real-time based on user interactions and changes in the underlying data.\n\n\n\nThis approach enhances visualization by providing a clear and immersive method to interact with mesh data. It improves user interaction through intuitive controls, allowing seamless engagement with the overlay. Performance is optimized by leveraging triangle edge data for efficient rendering. Additionally, the solution is scalable, enabling support for more complex interactions and data types in future developments.\n\n\n\nThe proposal adds complexity to the rendering pipeline, potentially complicating development. It may require increased processing power, which could limit accessibility on lower-end devices. Users may face a learning curve adapting to the new interaction methods. Furthermore, additional features will necessitate ongoing support and updates, leading to maintenance overhead.\n\n\n\nThe traditional way of doing outlines is via mesh extrusion. Alternative approaches include implementing a 2D overlay system with traditional interfaces, using point-based rendering instead of outlining edges, integrating existing third-party holographic tools instead of developing in-house solutions, and simplifying interactions by removing gesture-based controls.\n\n\n\nThe solution may see limited use in environments lacking hardware support for holographic or virtual reality displays. It may be unnecessary for simple projects that do not require advanced visualization or interaction features. High resource constraints could hinder support for the overlay, and some users may prefer traditional interfaces over holographic ones.\n\n\n\nYes, developing the holographic overlay aligns with V-Sekai’s mission to enhance social VR functionalities. Implementing this feature will strengthen our core offerings and provide significant value to our user base.\n\n\n\nStatus: Proposed \n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which integrates social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components into the Godot Engine.\nCESIUM Primitive Outline - Describes the CESIUM Primitive Outline extension for rendering triangle edges with high-quality, anti-aliased lines.\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: rejected\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire, antpb\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nThe VRM format is becoming increasingly popular in the field of 3D modeling and animation. It allows for easy sharing and transfer of humanoid 3D models with skeletal animations between different software applications. One such application is the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine.\n\n\n\nCurrently, developers working with VRM files in Godot Engine face difficulties when trying to convert these files to Blender format for further editing or manipulation.

The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:\n\nDelay Lines: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nMatrix Mixing: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nFeedback and Input/Output Processing: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\nReading and Writing Delay Line Buffers: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nInput and Output Audio Data: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware."

For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nFeedback and Input/Output Processing: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\nReading and Writing Delay Line Buffers: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nInput and Output Audio Data: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware."

The character can be in speaking or idle mode.\n\n\n\nThe resulting texts are displayed on this screen.\n\nNote: Currently, the system only supports speaking and idle states. Other modes are not available.\n\nThe choice of portrait mode for the display aligns with the specific needs and constraints of the project. As the project heavily relies on text-based interactions, specifically transcriptions, portrait mode allows more lines of text to be visible at once, thereby improving the user experience.\nThe system utilizes a 6-inch flexible OLED display from Wisecoco. Portrait mode is more space-efficient in such scenarios, taking up less horizontal space while still providing ample vertical space for text display.\nGiven that the primary focus of the project is voice interactions, the display mode should ideally support easy reading of transcriptions. Portrait mode, with its vertical orientation, is more suited to this task as it mimics the natural top-to-bottom reading flow.\nAccording to the system diagram, the processed data from the Whisper for Speech-to-Text module running on GGML is used to animate a virtual character and display the resulting texts. These texts are likely to be dialog or conversation-based, and portrait mode would allow for a more coherent and continuous display of these text blocks."

    "text": "This unit is a standard Linux amd64 computer that hosts the VRM1 Character Layer (B).\n\n\n\nThis module, running on GGML, captures audio input from the Microphone (E) and converts it into text.\n\n\n\nThe processed data from the Whisper module animates a virtual character in this layer. The character can be in speaking or idle mode.\n\n\n\nThe resulting texts are displayed on this screen.\n\nNote: Currently, the system only supports speaking and idle states. Other modes are not available.\n\nThe choice of portrait mode for the display aligns with the specific needs and constraints of the project. As the project heavily relies on text-based interactions, specifically transcriptions, portrait mode allows more lines of text to be visible at once, thereby improving the user experience.\nThe system utilizes a 6-inch flexible OLED display from Wisecoco. Portrait mode is more space-efficient in such scenarios, taking up less horizontal space while still providing ample vertical space for text display.\nGiven that the primary focus of the project is voice interactions, the display mode should ideally support easy reading of transcriptions. Portrait mode, with its vertical orientation, is more suited to this task as it mimics the natural top-to-bottom reading flow.\nAccording to the system diagram, the processed data from the Whisper for Speech-to-Text module running on GGML is used to animate a virtual character and display the resulting texts. These texts are likely to be dialog or conversation-based, and portrait mode would allow for a more coherent and continuous display of these text blocks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Draft \nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, Character Customization, Discord Bot, PoC\n\n\n\n\nWithin the V-Sekai community, there is a desire to enhance user engagement through interactive tools that allow for creative expression. The community seeks to leverage Discord as a platform to introduce such tools.\n\n\n\nThe current challenge is to create an interactive Discord bot that allows for immersive character customization, aligning with V-Sekai’s vision of fostering a creative and engaged community.\n\n\n\nTo create a Discord bot as a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the feasibility of character customization using trait-based input, we will execute the following steps:\n\nDefine Key Traits: We will select a set of fundamental character traits such as height, body shape, hair color, and clothing style. Each trait will be associated with a Unicode emoji for straightforward identification and interaction within the Discord interface.\nBot Development: A bot will be developed to parse textual commands linked to each trait. For example, a user might input !height 📏 to set the character’s height or !hair 🎨 to choose a hair color.\nImage Generation: The bot will map each trait to a specific set of 2D image assets. It will have the logic to composite these assets into a single image that represents the character based on the selected traits.\nUser Interaction: Reaction buttons for ‘like’ 👍, ‘dislike’ 👎, and ‘regenerate’ 🔄 will be implemented to allow users to interact with the generated character. This will provide immediate feedback mechanisms for the community.\nTesting and Iteration: The bot will be deployed in a controlled Discord environment and tested by real users. Their feedback will be crucial for refining the bot’s functionality and user experience.\nDocumentation: All development processes, user interactions, and iterations will be thoroughly documented. This documentation will be critical for understanding user needs and will inform future development cycles.\n\nThis PoC will serve to validate the core idea, engage the user community early in the development process, and provide critical insights for scaling the bot to handle more complex trait manipulation and 3D character rendering in future phases.\n\n\n\nImplementing this bot will potentially increase community engagement by providing a fun and interactive character creation tool. It will also lay the foundation for future developments in VR and character design within the V-Sekai ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe initial development of the bot may require significant resources and there is a risk of low user adoption. Additionally, ensuring the bot’s scalability and handling user feedback for improvements could be challenging.\n\n\n\nAlternatives, such as outsourcing the tool or purchasing an existing solution, were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of in-house development to retain creative control and better integration with V-Sekai’s infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThere might be less frequent use cases for the bot, such as character customization for one-time events or non-regular users. The bot’s design will need to account for these to ensure it remains relevant and accessible.\n\n\n\nThe core functionality of the bot aligns with V-Sekai’s objectives and values. The development will be handled internally to ensure the tool’s compatibility with the community’s needs and expectations.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai Official Website - Community of enthusiasts building a next-generation social and gaming VR platform powered by the Godot Engine 4.0\nNousResearch Yarn Mistral 7b 128k - Hugging Face - A Hugging Face Space by realgenius\nIssue #68 · polygonjs/polygonjs - GitHub - Discussion on using polygon.js as a Discord webhook watcher to output messages and attachments\n\nThis article was assisted by AI."

This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n\n\nSource: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json if the avatar is in GLTF format, or image/png or image/svg+xml if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.\nFilter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.\nSink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be image/png or image/svg+xml for 2D avatars, and application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json for 3D avatars.\n\nNote: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats.

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nAvatars are a strength of V-Sekai.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nCode complexity.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nReduz isn’t interested in OIT.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/master/doc/TressFX4xDeveloperGuide.pdf\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXPPLL.hlsl\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXShortCut.hlsl\nhttps://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html\nhttps://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/oit/oit.cpp\n\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It allows for inductive learning, which means it can handle unseen nodes without requiring retraining. This makes it particularly useful for dynamic graphs where nodes may be added or removed over time.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm’s performance heavily depends on the choice of aggregator functions and the quality of node features. Poorly chosen functions or low-quality features can lead to suboptimal embeddings. Additionally, the algorithm may not perform well on graphs with complex structures or those that lack sufficient node feature information.\n\n\n\nAlternative methods for generating node embeddings, such as transductive learning algorithms, could be considered. However, these methods typically require retraining when new nodes are added, making them less suitable for dynamic graphs.\n\n\n\nWhile GraphSAGE is highly effective for many graph-based machine learning tasks, it may not be the best choice for all scenarios. For instance, in cases where the graph structure is less important than node features, other methods like feature-based machine learning models might be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nYes, this explanation of the GraphSAGE algorithm has been developed by us, with assistance from AI assistant Aria.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs"

Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialog, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In collaborative projects, team members may edit the same scene in different ways. Version control systems (VCS) like Git can help manage these modifications through merging. However, merging scenes (TSCN format) can be challenging due to their complex semantics and potential for corruption.\n\n\n\nTo prevent scene corruption after merging, the Godot Editor should provide a merge scene window that allows users to merge TSCN files.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers have been studying emergent AI behaviors in sandbox environments inspired by games like The Sims. This proposal aims to leverage these insights to enhance the V-Sekai game, which features 25 NPCs running goal-task hierarchical task network (GT-HTN).\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to create a dynamic and engaging environment where NPCs exhibit complex behaviors that can be streamed 24/7. The goal is to make the game interesting enough for Twitch streaming while ensuring the NPCs’ actions are meaningful and not just random clicks.\n\n\n\nFor HTN implementation, we will study the GOAP framework from Vinicius Gerevini’s GitHub and define tasks and goals for NPCs using predicate, subject-object triplet variables, or method calls. Networking and traffic simulation will involve implementing network traffic tests to ensure smooth operation and using tools like Microsoft’s GraphRAG for generating predicate and subject objects. For LLM integration, we will integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to set goals for NPCs based on Twitch chat summaries, using LLMs to help plan but not directly control NPC actions.\n\n\nNPC Interaction Flow:\ngraph TD;\n    A[Start] --&gt; B[Define Goals];\n    B --&gt; C[Assign Tasks];\n    C --&gt; D[Execute Actions];\n    D --&gt; E[Monitor and Adjust];\n    E --&gt; F[Stream to Twitch];\nSystem Architecture:\ngraph LR;\n    A[User Input] --&gt; B[LLM];\n    B --&gt; C[Goal Setting];\n    C --&gt; D[GTHTN Engine];\n    D --&gt; E[NPC Actions];\n    E --&gt; F[Twitch Stream];\n\n\n\n\nCreating an interactive and dynamic environment suitable for Twitch streaming will result in engaging content. It allows for complex and unpredictable NPC interactions, fostering emergent behaviors. Additionally, it engages the community by summarizing Twitch chat to set NPC goals.\n\n\n\nImplementing and maintaining such a system can be challenging due to its complexity. It also requires significant computational resources for real-time processing and streaming.\n\n\n\nManually setting NPC goals and actions would be less dynamic and engaging. Using simpler AI models may not exhibit complex behaviors.\n\n\n\nRunning the game without Twitch integration, focusing solely on NPC interactions, represents an infrequent use case.\n\n\n\nWe will implement the GOAP framework within the V-Sekai game and integrate LLMs for goal setting based on community input.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft \n\n\n\nThe decision makers for this proposal are the V-Sekai development team.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nFor more information, you can visit the V-Sekai GitHub account, which focuses on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, Chatbot GPT4 assistance\n\n\n\n\nEnable creation of more dynamic and engaging environments within V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai, an open-source virtual reality platform, aims to deliver a user-friendly experience for the VR community. To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\nTo further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai’s capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.\nThe implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant MembraneFramework\n  participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  participant ElixirNx\n  participant AIMLFramework\n  participant Yugabyte\n\n  rect rgb(240, 248, 255)\n    note over MembraneFramework, Yugabyte: Toggle Actions\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient: TOGGLE_GAME_ENGINE_AND_CLIENTS\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;ElixirNx: ACCELERATE_MEMBRANE_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;AIMLFramework: TOGGLE_AIML_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;Yugabyte: TOGGLE_YUGABYTE\n  end\n\n  box \"Source\" #CCFFCC\n    participant MembraneFramework\n    participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  end\n\n  box \"Filter\" #FFFFCC\n    participant ElixirNx\n    participant AIMLFramework\n  end\n\n  box \"Sink & Source of Data\" #FFCCCC\n    participant Yugabyte\n  end\n\n\nWe propose using read replicas for applications needing single-zone writes and multi-region reads. Benefits include:\n\nResilience: Zone-level resilience with primary cluster nodes across multiple zones.\nConsistency: Timeline consistency in replica clusters, better than eventual consistency.\nLatency: Quick reads from primary and replica clusters; write latency depends on client-primary cluster distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved functionality and versatility of V-Sekai\nEnhanced compatibility with other tools and platforms\nGreater potential for collaboration and community involvement\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased complexity in implementation and maintenance\nPotential performance overhead due to integration of multiple components\n\n\n\n\n\nStandalone procedural generation: Implementing procedural generation as a standalone feature without integrating it with the Godot Engine server.

    "text": "V-Sekai, an open-source virtual reality platform, aims to deliver a user-friendly experience for the VR community. To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\nTo further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai’s capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.\nThe implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant MembraneFramework\n  participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  participant ElixirNx\n  participant AIMLFramework\n  participant Yugabyte\n\n  rect rgb(240, 248, 255)\n    note over MembraneFramework, Yugabyte: Toggle Actions\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient: TOGGLE_GAME_ENGINE_AND_CLIENTS\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;ElixirNx: ACCELERATE_MEMBRANE_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;AIMLFramework: TOGGLE_AIML_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;Yugabyte: TOGGLE_YUGABYTE\n  end\n\n  box \"Source\" #CCFFCC\n    participant MembraneFramework\n    participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  end\n\n  box \"Filter\" #FFFFCC\n    participant ElixirNx\n    participant AIMLFramework\n  end\n\n  box \"Sink & Source of Data\" #FFCCCC\n    participant Yugabyte\n  end\n\n\nWe propose using read replicas for applications needing single-zone writes and multi-region reads. Benefits include:\n\nResilience: Zone-level resilience with primary cluster nodes across multiple zones.\nConsistency: Timeline consistency in replica clusters, better than eventual consistency.\nLatency: Quick reads from primary and replica clusters; write latency depends on client-primary cluster distance."

    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a virtual reality (VR) platform that offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This proposal aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. These challenges affect the usability and variety of experiences for the users. To overcome these challenges and enhance the V-Sekai user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n\nWe propose focusing on Generating More Worlds as the first step towards enhancing V-Sekai. By creating new VR worlds within V-Sekai, users will have a wider range of experiences to explore. This involves designing and implementing new environments to expand the options available. With more worlds to choose from, users will have increased engagement and longer sessions within the V-Sekai platform.\n\n\n\n\nTo generate more worlds for V-Sekai, we will follow a comprehensive strategy that includes the following steps:\n\nIdentify User Preferences: Understand the target audience and their preferences. Research popular VR themes, genres, and settings to get an idea of what users would enjoy.\nDesign New Environments: Use 3D modeling software like Blender or Unity to design new virtual environments for V-Sekai. Consider creating diverse worlds like fantasy realms, futuristic cities, natural landscapes, or historical settings.\nImplement Interactive Elements: Make the new worlds interactive by adding objects, characters, and elements that users can engage with. This can include non-playable characters (NPCs), puzzles, hidden items, or mini-games within each world.\nTest and Refine: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new worlds are visually appealing, optimized for performance, and provide a seamless VR experience. Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements based on their suggestions.\nIntegrate with V-Sekai: Once the new worlds are ready, integrate them into the V-Sekai platform. Ensure they are easily accessible through the menus or navigation system within V-Sekai’s VR interface.\nRelease and Promote: Launch the updated version of V-Sekai with the newly generated worlds. Promote the release through various channels, such as social media, gaming forums, Virtual Reality communities, and V-Sekai’s official website.\n\nBy following this strategy, we will not only address the current limitations but also create an engaging and immersive VR experience for V-Sekai users.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased user engagement: The availability of more worlds will provide users with greater options to explore, leading to longer sessions and increased immersion in V-Sekai.\nExpanded user base: With a wider range of experiences, V-Sekai will attract new users who are looking for diverse VR environments.\nPositive word-of-mouth: Satisfied users will share their experiences with others, generating positive reviews and recommendations for V-Sekai.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment complexity: Creating new worlds requires significant effort and resources, including 3D modeling, programming, and testing. This may lead to increased development time and costs.\nUpfront investment: Generating more worlds will require upfront investment in terms of design, implementation, and integration with V-Sekai.\nUser feedback and iteration: Continuous user feedback is crucial to refine and improve the new worlds. This iterative process may extend the development timeline.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative solution that was considered was Integrating Backend Services. This would involve improving the backend infrastructure of V-Sekai to enhance scalability, performance, and reliability. However, after careful consideration, we prioritize generating more worlds as it directly addresses user experience limitations and provides tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and appeal.\n\n\n\nThe generation of more worlds is within the core capabilities of our team at V-Sekai. We have experienced 3D designers, developers, and testers who are skilled in creating immersive VR environments. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to execute this proposed solution effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect of this proposal, please feel free to ask."

    "text": "The V-Sekai project aims to enhance the Godot Engine with social VR functionality. Currently, the project uses a forked version of the Godot Engine, which complicates development and maintenance due to frequent updates from the main Godot repository.\n\n\n\nThe V-Sekai team faces challenges with maintaining a forked version of the Godot Engine. Some team members prefer using the stock Godot Engine to avoid long compilation times and complex build processes. Additionally, there is a need for faster and more secure scripting capabilities than what GDScript offers.\n\n\n\nIf we move all core scripts to Wasm, we’ll need to make only one GDExtension, and then it will never change. So it will be one build that we can all share.

Perfectly matching the old API sounds really, really hard. But if we’re allowed to take shortcuts and figure out workarounds, MMMaellon thinks making a Wasm layer that allows us to do enough is doable. As long as the bar isn’t that it has to be an exact perfect replica of the old API.\nWe propose separating the core scripts into WebAssembly (Wasm) modules. This approach allows us to use the stock Godot Engine while leveraging the performance benefits of Wasm.\nThe core scripts will be loaded as Wasm modules, and a single GDExtension will handle the integration between Godot and the Wasm runtime.\n\n\n\nCore Scripts in Wasm: Move all core scripts to Wasm modules. These scripts will handle essential functionalities like security checks and editor tools.\nGDExtension for Wasm Integration: Develop a GDExtension that loads and executes the Wasm modules. This extension will act as a bridge between Godot and the Wasm runtime.\nSingle Binary Distribution: By using Wasm, we can distribute a single binary executable that includes the GDExtension and Wasm modules, simplifying the deployment process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: Wasm provides near-native performance, making it faster than GDScript.\nSecurity: Wasm’s sandboxed environment enhances security by isolating the execution of scripts.\nMaintainability: Using the stock Godot Engine reduces the burden of maintaining a forked version and simplifies updates.\nFlexibility: Developers can write core scripts in languages that compile to Wasm, such as C++ or Rust.\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity: Developing and integrating Wasm modules adds complexity to the project.\nLearning Curve: Team members may need to learn new technologies and tools related to Wasm.\n\n\n\n\n\nSticking with Forked Godot: Continuing to use a forked version of Godot would require ongoing maintenance and could deter contributors.\nUsing Only GDExtension: While GDExtension provides native performance, it requires code signing and can be cumbersome to manage across multiple modules.\n\n\n\n\nIn scenarios where the performance and security benefits of Wasm are not critical, simpler scripting solutions like GDScript or native GDExtensions might suffice.\n\n\n\nThis proposal involves significant changes to the core architecture of the V-Sekai project.

    "text": "Thunderbolt Driver Issue Solution\nTo all who end up in this thread, as I did. Welcome\nAnother user in this thread had a solution that worked for me, so I will repeat it with a more detailed explanation.\nCredit to “Johnatan” on page 3\nThe issue is that the new Thunderbolt drivers fail to remove and overwrite the old drivers. The problem can be resolved through the device manager.\nRight-click on “Start” (the Windows icon at the corner of your taskbar) and select “Device Manager.”\nWithin the device manager, open the category “System Devices.”\nScroll down to Thunderbolt(TM) Controller - (model number here)\n*Right-click on it, select “Uninstall Device,” and check the box “Delete the driver software for this device.”\nOnce removed, rerun the Thunderbolt installer or the update through the Dell Command Updater.\n*If you are worried about uninstalling the driver in the device manager, fret not. The driver will reinstall itself on reboot if you have an internet connection."

Each stage builds upon the previous one, gradually expanding the project’s scope and capabilities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\n\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[Avatar Loading] --&gt; B1[Simple Demo with VRM Avatar]\n    A --&gt; B2[VRM & Unity Import - Maintain and Improve]\n    A --&gt; B3[Network Code Reconciliation - Godot Network System]\n    A --&gt; B4[Jitter in Network Interpolation]\n    A --&gt; B5[Implement jitter and playback buffer for Voice]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Mid Term\n    B4 --&gt; C[Network]\n    C --&gt; D1[Entity System & Background Loading]\n    C --&gt; D2[Background Loading - Re-evaluate with Multithreaded Scene Tree]\n    C --&gt; D3[UI Work - Fix VR UI & Improve Interaction]\n    C --&gt; D4[Lightweight Relay Instance Server - Single Process, Multiple Instances]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Long Term\n    D4 --&gt; E[Scalable Instances]\n    E --&gt; F1[Network Topology Implementation]\n    E --&gt; F2[Streamlined Content Creation - Better Workflow]\n    E --&gt; F3[Zero Stutter when Loading Content - Address Bottlenecks]\n    E --&gt; F4[Social and Upload Features - Enhance User Experience]\n    E --&gt; F5[Video and Audio Work - Streaming Integration]\n    E --&gt; F6[Scripting Integrations - WASM-based Scripts]\n    E --&gt; F7[UX Work for Non-Technical Users - Accessible UI]\n    E --&gt; F8[Loading VRM Avatars - Streamlined Process]\n    E --&gt; F9[In-Editor Content Building UX - Non-Technical Users]\n  end\nThe discussion involves the development of V-Sekai, a project with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In the short term, the focus is on avatar loading, simple demos, VRM & Unity import, network code reconciliation, adding network interpolation, and voice jitter buffer. Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.\nOne challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.\nIn addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.\nIt’s important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo. This is a process.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

This greater flow state occurs because you don’t have to switch contexts, allowing for continuous interaction and focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed system will allow users to interact directly with avatar bone structures in a 3D space, manipulating constraints through intuitive gestures and tools. This approach aims to enhance user engagement and precision in modifying avatars.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Representation of Bones:\n\nEach bone will be represented by a dot that becomes visible and enlarges when the user’s hand or controller approaches it, facilitating easy selection.\n\nAvoiding Selection Mechanism:\n\nInstead of using a traditional selection mechanism, the system will employ proximity-based interaction. When a user’s hand or controller is near a bone, the relevant constraints automatically appear, allowing immediate manipulation without the need for explicit selection. This reduces complexity and enhances flow in the immersive environment.\n\nConstraint Manipulation Tools:\n\nA virtual tool palette will be available to the user, containing different constraint modifiers.\nUsers can grab these tools and attach them to bones to adjust constraints like positions and rotations.\n\nTool Switcher Interface:\n\nIn addition to the tool palette, a tool switcher mechanism will be implemented allowing users to quickly switch between tools without returning to the palette. This could be activated via a gesture or a button press, bringing up a radial or linear menu to select the desired tool.\n\nIntuitive Constraint Adjustment:\n\nFor position constraints, a 3D gizmo will appear, allowing users to manipulate the position directly within the VR space.\nFor rotational constraints, a 3D gizmo will appear, allowing users to manipulate the angle directly within the VR space.\nTwist constraints will be adjusted using a 2d disk arc interface where permissible rotation areas are defined by the user.\nSwing constraints can be adjusted using a spherical interface where permissible rotation areas are defined by the user.\nSwing constraints can be adjusted using a 2d orbit map interface where permissible rotation areas are defined by the user.\n\nFeedback and Precision:\n\nVisual and haptic feedback will be provided to ensure users are aware of the changes they are making.\nPrecision tools and snapping features will help in making exact adjustments.\n\nDeselection and Context Switching:\n\nMoving the controller away from the bones or performing a specific gesture will clear the current interaction, allowing for a smooth workflow without accidental adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\n[User Interface Mock-up]\n+------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                |\n|  [Avatar]                                      |\n|    * (Head)                                    |\n|    * (Shoulder)                                |\n|    * (Elbow) &lt;-- [Interacting]                 |\n|    * (Wrist)                                   |\n|                                                |\n|  [Tool Palette]                                |\n|    - Grab Tool                                 |\n|    - Rotate Tool                               |\n|    - Swing Tool                                |\n|    - Twist Tool                                |\n|                                                |\n|  [Tool Switcher]                               |\n|    - Quick Switch Gesture                      |\n|    - Radial Menu for Tool Selection            |\n|                                                |\n+------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience: Direct manipulation of bones and constraints in VR enhances the intuitiveness and enjoyment of avatar customization.\nIncreased Precision: Fine control over adjustments leads to more accurate and satisfying results.\nSeamless Workflow: Integration of tools and interactions within the VR environment reduces the cognitive load and context switching, fostering a more creative and productive user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity in Implementation: Developing a fully interactive 3D UI with precise control mechanisms can be challenging and time-consuming.\nPerformance Concerns: High fidelity models and real-time updates in VR may lead to performance issues on lower-end systems.\nIn a shared space app on the Apple Vision Pro neither switching or tool palette will work.\nIn an immersive app on the Apple Vision Pro either switching or tool palette will work with hand tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\n2D GUI for Constraint Management: Using a traditional 2D interface for constraint management was considered but rejected due to the lack of immersion and intuitiveness in a VR context.\n\nThe implementation of scale for matching clothing to the character’s body, as well as the adjustment of constraint weight, will be addressed in future work.\n\n\n\nThis feature is core to the V-Sekai project’s mission of enhancing VR interaction and will be developed internally to maintain control over quality and integration.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft \n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\nFire\nNova\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai, interactive presence, unfolding complexity, avatar dots, maximum precision, angle constraints, twist constraint, sphere visualization, constraint palette, tool shadow, localized selection, proprioceptive action, switcher interface, tool palette, deselection method, user flow\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/lasso - GitHub for vr interaction.\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

    "text": "Draft: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: superseded by 20230602-limited-tracker-placement.md \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\nRight Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\nLeft Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\nRight Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "title": "Accepted: Use the Humanoid Profile for Character Motion Mirroring",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Daniel Snd was looking for a simple way to mirror right-sided walking keyframes on a character avatar motion.\n\n\n\nDaniel Snd did not utilize the Godot Engine humanoid profile.\n\n\n\nThe solution is to use the Godot Engine humanoid profile.\n\n\nIn Godot Engine, the animation humanoid profile is essential for managing bone rolls in incoming humanoid skeletons. This is because these skeletons often have arbitrary bone rolls that need to be standardized for consistent animation behavior.\n\n\nBone roll refers to the rotation around the bone’s longitudinal axis. In 3D modeling and animation, it’s important to correctly set up bone rolls as they determine the axes of rotation for the bones during animation.\n\n\n\nThe SkeletonProfileHumanoid in Godot 4.0 adopts a practical rule for managing bone rolls:\n\nThe +Y axis should point from the parent joint to the child joint. This is considered as the roll axis.\nThe +X rotation should bend the joints towards the body’s inside (almost the direction of muscle contraction).\n\n\n\n\nIf you mirror animations, the bone rolls and names may need to be corrected. This is because the orientation of the bones can get flipped during the mirroring process. The Godot Humanoid Profile applies a Bone Rule to the bone rolls.\n\n\n\nThe Godot Humanoid Profile standardizes the bone names consistently, it allows one to reuse animations across different characters. For example, if one has a walking animation for one character and one wants to apply it to another character, having the same bone names will allow one to do this without any additional work.\n\n\n\nIn 3D animation, the T-Pose is a standard pose where the character stands upright with their arms extended straight out to the sides. This pose is often used as the default pose for rigging and animating characters because it provides a clear view of all parts of the character. However, not all models are initially in a T-Pose. If you have a model in any other pose (let’s say it’s an A-Pose), you might need to convert it to a T-Pose before you can use it effectively in Godot.\n\n\n\n\nThe engine can ensure that all humanoid animations behave consistently, regardless of the original orientation or roll of the bones in the imported skeleton by following the Bone Rule. This makes it easier to create and manage humanoid animations, especially when working with different humanoids that may have been rigged differently.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Godot Humanoid Profile will allow for consistent behavior across all humanoid animations, making it easier to create and manage these animations.

    "text": "The solution is to use the Godot Engine humanoid profile.\n\n\nIn Godot Engine, the animation humanoid profile is essential for managing bone rolls in incoming humanoid skeletons. This is because these skeletons often have arbitrary bone rolls that need to be standardized for consistent animation behavior.\n\n\nBone roll refers to the rotation around the bone’s longitudinal axis. In 3D modeling and animation, it’s important to correctly set up bone rolls as they determine the axes of rotation for the bones during animation.\n\n\n\nThe SkeletonProfileHumanoid in Godot 4.0 adopts a practical rule for managing bone rolls:\n\nThe +Y axis should point from the parent joint to the child joint. This is considered as the roll axis.\nThe +X rotation should bend the joints towards the body’s inside (almost the direction of muscle contraction).\n\n\n\n\nIf you mirror animations, the bone rolls and names may need to be corrected. This is because the orientation of the bones can get flipped during the mirroring process. The Godot Humanoid Profile applies a Bone Rule to the bone rolls.\n\n\n\nThe Godot Humanoid Profile standardizes the bone names consistently, it allows one to reuse animations across different characters. For example, if one has a walking animation for one character and one wants to apply it to another character, having the same bone names will allow one to do this without any additional work.\n\n\n\nIn 3D animation, the T-Pose is a standard pose where the character stands upright with their arms extended straight out to the sides. This pose is often used as the default pose for rigging and animating characters because it provides a clear view of all parts of the character. However, not all models are initially in a T-Pose. If you have a model in any other pose (let’s say it’s an A-Pose), you might need to convert it to a T-Pose before you can use it effectively in Godot.\n\n\n\n\nThe engine can ensure that all humanoid animations behave consistently, regardless of the original orientation or roll of the bones in the imported skeleton by following the Bone Rule. This makes it easier to create and manage humanoid animations, especially when working with different humanoids that may have been rigged differently."

However, it has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. This proposal aims to rewrite the code using Elixir and the Membrane Framework.\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n  A[Ubisoft's Mixer Broadcaster Code] --&gt; B[Elixir & Membrane Framework Code]\n  C[No Authentication] --&gt; D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]\n  E[No Database] --&gt; F[Khepri Database Library]\nThis strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework’s unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, and implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on.\nHere are the key steps:\n\nCodebase: Transition from Ubisoft’s Mixer Broadcaster Code to Elixir & Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.\nDependencies: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.\nConfig: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.\nBacking Services: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.\nBuild, Release, Run: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir & Membrane Framework Code.\nProcesses: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.\nPort Binding: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.\nConcurrency: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.\nDisposability: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.\nDev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.\nLogs: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.\nAdmin Processes: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.\n\n\n\n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, and implementing the Khepri database library, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance. This will allow for more users to use the system simultaneously without experiencing delays or lags. Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.\n\n\n\nRewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, and the Khepri database library.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to optimize the existing code instead of rewriting it. However, this would not have addressed the inherent limitations of the current system.\n\n\n\nIn cases where the number of users is low and real-time updates are not critical, the current system may still be sufficient. However, as the user base grows and the demand for real-time updates increases, the need for a more scalable and efficient system becomes apparent.\n\n\n\nYes, the rewriting of the code will indeed be done by us as we also maintain the uro backend services.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nElixir\nMembrane Framework\nKhepri Database Library\n\nThis article is assisted by AI."

    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, AI, Game Development, Outlier Detection\n\n\n\n\nGame assets often contain defects. Aria, an AI-based game creation assistant, can help detect and rectify these issues by calling necessary functions to perform tests.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to efficiently identify and correct common errors in game assets, ranging from minor glitches to major bugs. Manual detection is time-consuming and prone to human error. Additionally, managing the size of data being processed by a large language model (LLM) with a 128k token context presents a challenge.\n\n\n\nWe propose implementing an AI-Based Outlier Detector game creation assistant that detects common errors. This system would analyze game assets, identify anomalies, and suggest corrections.

The main components of the system will be:\nThe Headless CLI will implement desync for data synchronization and provide commands for displaying help information, version information, switching modes, checking current mode, listing all available modes, and updating according to semantic versioning.\nThe Updater Online Service will be a lightweight service that uses Elixir for handling web requests and CockroachDB for persistence. It will integrate the desync protocol and include error handling strategies for failed updates or data synchronization issues.\nThe GUI Launcher will be designed using the Godot Engine and will also integrate the desync protocol.

    "text": "The strategy for this proposal is to develop a headless backend launcher using Elixir and CockroachDB. The main components of the system will be:\nThe Headless CLI will implement desync for data synchronization and provide commands for displaying help information, version information, switching modes, checking current mode, listing all available modes, and updating according to semantic versioning.\nThe Updater Online Service will be a lightweight service that uses Elixir for handling web requests and CockroachDB for persistence. It will integrate the desync protocol and include error handling strategies for failed updates or data synchronization issues.\nThe GUI Launcher will be designed using the Godot Engine and will also integrate the desync protocol. It will feature a basic visual setup with V-Sekai branding.\nThe Game Sample will involve developing a basic visual sample with V-Sekai branding, planning for testing each component to ensure functionality, addressing security concerns including user data protection and secure updates, and discussing scalability potential with increasing users or larger game updates.\nEach table will have its own schema module representing different aspects of the application such as modes, versions, and update processes."

How can we improve the workflow to better maintain the project’s organization and compatibility?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nImplement a Git subrepo management system to separate assets and libraries, enabling easier tracking and synchronization between branches. This solution streamlines the development process\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nConfigure the Git subrepo to automatically update and synchronize with the main project.\nUse the Git subrepo in each branch to maintain consistent asset and library versions.\nAvoid storing godot and modules inside of the v-sekai-game.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved organization and compatibility of assets and libraries across branches.\nSimplified workflow for project updates and synchronization.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nPotential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Git subrepo management.\nPossible limitations in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nWorkarounds using scripts may be possible, but they are likely to be less efficient and more prone to errors compared to a Git subrepo management system.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a few lines of code. It is also devops.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIntegrating a Git subrepo management system as a core feature ensures consistency and maintainability across the entire V-Sekai project. It promotes better collaboration among team members and streamlines the development process.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nGit Subrepo Documentation"

To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\niex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nCreate a user in the website register user page.\nGo to the console and set the user to be admin.\niex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server\n# TODO\n# Call Uro.Accounts.update_user_as_admin\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Its adaptability and functionality make it an integral part of our operations.\n\n\n\nThe challenge at hand is to build the V-Sekai editor for multiple platforms, thereby enhancing its accessibility and usability.\n\n\n\nOur approach to this problem involves leveraging existing resources and tools:\n\nUtilize our existing gocd pipeline.\nEmploy osxcross for Mac builds.\nUse mingw for Windows builds.\nApply clang for Linux builds.\nImplement emscripten for web assembly.\nUtilize the android sdk on linux for Android builds.\n\nIn addition to these steps, we will also implement automated testing to ensure consistency across all systems. This will involve creating test scripts that can run on each platform, checking for any discrepancies or issues.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to showcase V-Sekai in October 2024. To achieve this, we need to prepare for various hardware targets. This multi-platform build will significantly enhance our reach and impact.\n\n\n\nThe primary downside is the potential complexity and challenges associated with managing and testing numerous build targets. Automated testing should help mitigate this issue, but it will still require careful management and oversight.\n\n\n\nWe could have chosen to focus on a single platform, but this would limit the reach and versatility of V-Sekai. By targeting multiple platforms, we can ensure that V-Sekai is accessible to a wider audience.\n\n\n\nWhile the main use case is for regular users, there may be infrequent use cases where developers or other tech-savvy individuals might want to customize or extend the functionality of V-Sekai. Our multi-platform approach caters to these users as well.\n\n\n\nThis project is core to our mission and will be executed by me. We believe that having control over the development process will allow us to maintain the high quality and consistency that we strive for.\n\n\n\nStatus: Draft \n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai development team\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - This is the GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project, which brings social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\n\nThis proposal was assisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nThe current Godot humanoid skeleton system lacks proper constraints for all bones, specifically in terms of rotation swing and rotation twist limits. This has led to issues when trying to move parts of the skeleton such as the head or legs towards the torso.\n\n\n\nThe challenge lies in implementing these constraints without causing other issues within the system. Some bones are not solved and should not be constrained, adding complexity to the task.\n\n\n\nThe strategy is to carefully analyze each bone and determine the appropriate constraints. This will involve a combination of swing rotation and twist rotation constraints, depending on the specific bone.\n\n\n\nBy implementing these constraints, we can improve the functionality and reliability of the Godot humanoid skeleton system. This will allow for more realistic movements and prevent system errors when moving certain parts of the skeleton.\n\n\n\nThere may be potential challenges in implementing these constraints, particularly for the unsolved bones. It will require careful testing and adjustment to ensure that the new constraints do not introduce new issues.\n\n\n\nAn alternative would be to leave the system as it is, accepting its limitations. However, this would mean missing out on the potential improvements that could be achieved through this proposal.\n\n\n\nIn some rare cases, the lack of constraints might actually be beneficial, allowing for unusual or exaggerated movements. These cases will need to be considered and potentially addressed separately.\n\n\n\nYes, this change would be implemented in the core system by the V-Sekai team.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI."

This allows for high-quality models that are optimized for performance.\n\n\n\nThe upside is that this approach allows for more detailed models while still maintaining good performance.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that it requires additional processing to create the LOD models, which could potentially slow down the development process.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to manually create lower detail models for use in less demanding scenarios. However, this would require significantly more work from the creators.\n\n\n\nThis strategy might not be beneficial for very simple models or scenes where the level of detail is not a significant factor.\n\n\n\nYes, this strategy is implemented in the core of our platform and maintained by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI."

    "text": "Draft: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: Draft \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nVR Tracker USB dongles need line of sight.\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement. Placed behind the body.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.\nRight Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"
