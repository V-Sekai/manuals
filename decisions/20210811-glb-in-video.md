# Draft: GLB data in a Movie

### Context and Problem Statement

Store ~20 mb of glb data in a mp4.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Matroska supports storage of related files and data in the Attachments Element (a Top-Level Element). Attachment Elements can be used to store related cover art, font files, transcripts, reports, error recovery files, picture, or text-based annotations, copies of specifications, or other ancillary files related to the Segment.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Store a glb in a mkv in the attachment sections.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Maybe a small script.
