# Draft: shadermotion to BVH

## Context and Problem Statement

Lacking characters motions to work with.

Transferring motions across platforms via video.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

# shadermotion allows us to transfer motion for other VR platforms into a standard motion format

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

ShaderMotion: "OBS" etc. motion captured video from VRChat.

Example: [Floss.mp4](https://gitlab.com/lox9973/ShaderMotion/-/raw/master/Example/Motion/Floss.mp4)

(repo: [lox9973/ShaderMotion](https://gitlab.com/lox9973/ShaderMotion))

**ShaderMotion => BVH**

- input: mpeg4
- output: bvh

#### Requirements

- .mp4 #shadermotion video
- [shadermotion-to-bvh by guillefix](https://github.com/guillefix/shadermotion-to-bvh/releases)
  - download shadermotion-to-bvh.zip from XXX github repo releases
  - unpack to a folder

#### Conversion Process

Run `shadermotion2.exe --video "yourvideo.mp4"`

KEEP THE WINDOW FOCUSED

Once completed, look for `yourvideo.bvh`

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to have motion for characters

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Many steps

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

# shadermotion is a novel solution to capturing motion from VRChat

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This document describes how to integrate #shadermotion with us.
