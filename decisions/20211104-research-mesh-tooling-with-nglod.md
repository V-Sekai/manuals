## Context and Problem Statement

Need geometric tools for many things in the V-Sekai.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use nglod for some of the 3d geometric tools.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. `git clone https://github.com/nv-tlabs/nglod.git`
1. Install <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge>
1. `conda create --name nglod python=3.9`
1. `conda activate nglod`
1. `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch`
1. `pip install -r ./infra/requirements.txt`

```
python app/main.py --net OctreeSDF --num-lods 5 --dataset-path data/armadillo.obj --epoch 250 --exp-name armadillo
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Maybe possible to encode as onnx
- Maybe usable cpu only.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Might require the GPU.
- Inferencing may be difficult at interactive rates.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

CUDA, PyTorch and c++ are significant works.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I have an approach!
