# Proposed: Improving Connectivity for Valve StreamVR Light House Dongles

## The Context

Valve StreamVR Light House Dongles are unable to connect.

## The Problem Statement

Valve StreamVR Light House Dongles are unable to connect because of wireless interference if plugged into hubs upright and side by side.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use the supplied HTCVive cradles for the dongles. Keep the dongles upright.

## The Benefits

- **Reduced Interference:** By using the supplied cradles and keeping the dongles upright, wireless interference is minimized.
- **Improved Connectivity:** Ensures stable and reliable connections for the Valve StreamVR Light House Dongles.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple implementation that leverages existing hardware (HTCVive cradles).

## The Downsides

- **Additional Space Required:** Using cradles may require more physical space compared to plugging dongles directly into a hub.
- **Potential Cost:** If users do not already have the HTCVive cradles, they may need to purchase them separately.

## The Road Not Taken

- **Alternative Positioning:** Exploring other physical arrangements for the dongles without using cradles.
- **Software Solutions:** Investigating software-based solutions to mitigate wireless interference.

## The Infrequent Use Case

- **Limited Setup Scenarios:** Users with unique setups where space constraints make it difficult to use the cradles effectively.

## In Core and Done by Us

- **Implementation:** The V-Sekai development team will handle the implementation and testing of this proposal.
- **Documentation:** Detailed instructions and guidelines will be provided to users for setting up their dongles using the cradles.
