| 20   | A process is established for moving files between "Project Mirage" and Godot Engine, like setting up a conveyor belt between two factories.                                                   | Dealt with issues with "Project Mirage"'s material counts and bones                                                    |
| 21   | Vroid Hub's hair painter and mesh generator are used, like using a special tool to add hair to a doll.                                                                                        | Established process for moving files between "Project Mirage" and Godot Engine                                         |
| 22   | "Perfect sync", which are facial expressions for motion capture, is added, like giving a puppet the ability to show emotions.                                                                 | Used Vroid Hub's hair painter and mesh generator                                                                       |
