## Context and Problem Statement

Want to list some useful tools for world and character creation and are free, open-source and remixable for commercial uses.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

There many tools out there that are helpful for world and character creation.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. An ESRGAN model made for upscaling normal maps. <https://github.com/RunDevelopment/ESRGAN-models/tree/main/normals>
2. A Blender vrm addon. <https://vrm-addon-for-blender.info/en/>
3. The easiest way to install and use Stable Diffusion <https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui#installation>
4. Image prompt interrogator <https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator/tree/main>
5. Repository for artwork and community for filming <https://open3dlab.com/>
6. Image Upscaling GUI based on ESRGAN <https://github.com/n00mkrad/cupscale>
7. Discover trending open-source projects and their alternatives <https://www.libhunt.com/>
8. Hugging Face arrives to the Elixir community <https://huggingface.co/blog/elixir-bumblebee>

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

A place to put related tools is helpful.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

A small amount of space and time is used.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

These are not small tools.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Writing down stuff that's useful.
