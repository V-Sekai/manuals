## Context and Problem Statement

<!-- Describe the problem or limitation you are having in your project. You may want to articulate the problem in the form of a question. -->

Godot Engine and V-Sekai are fast moving projects.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Write down how to update the engine and the game.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. First step: change the `update_vsekai_godot` script to push to a staging branch.
1. Next step (lazy and simple): it is your responsibility to build the engine, run groups project and make sure it works.
1. Optionally: you should perform an export build and make sure that works too.
1. Next step (less lazy): we add another set of CI pipelines for staging godot -> staging templates -> staging groups
   and then we test that
1. Most issues aren't export related, so I think engine build + open project and run project is probably sufficient for most things
   and we need a script to push staging -> groups-4.x
1. Which means everyone gets the upgraded engine

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

Creating a standard procedure means people know what to do.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

It's complicated.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a procedure and not code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We know how to do this and others don't.
