# Draft: Make it easier to propose and file bugs by simplifying the templates

## Context and Problem Statement

About issue templates, I know Godot doesn't permit plain feature requests in the main godot issue tracker. To propose something you have to have a fleshed out proposal.

That works well for Godot for two reasons: Godot has lots of users so there are already too many feature proposals; and the users of Godot are developers who can be asked to do research and write a whole implementation proposal

The users of V-Sekai are not technical in the same way; and furthermore we are not at the scale Godot was in 3.2 when they switched to requiring proposals.

If we ever do get big enough that feature requests propose a burden then we can consider making it harder to file them

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Modify the V-Sekai-game issue templates to be easier to use.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Remove required fields. Make them easier to use.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

- More bug filing
- More proposals

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

- More work on the devs to catalog

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the repos.
