### Context and Problem Statement

Disconnect IPFS from the internet

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Disconnect IPFS so it can be standalone packages.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Implement https://github.com/skogard/nebulus as a c++ library.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

May be able to be done by others.

### Positive Consequences

- send a offline package

### Negative Consequences
