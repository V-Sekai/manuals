## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is a project in the realm of virtual reality. Our aim is to create immersive and interactive virtual worlds that offer users an awesome experience.

## The Challenge

It's important to have a slogan that encapsulates our vision and mission. It should be catchy, memorable, and reflective of what we do.

## The Strategy

We propose the slogan: **V-Sekai: Gateways to Virtual Worlds**

This slogan succinctly communicates our goal of providing access to expansive virtual realities.

## The Upside

The proposed slogan is concise, catchy, and directly related to our work. It emphasizes our role as a gateway to new, immersive experiences.

## The Downside

The term "Virtual Worlds" might be too broad or vague for some people, potentially leading to misunderstandings about our specific services.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative slogans were considered, such as "V-Sekai: Forging Gateways to Virtual Worlds", but they didn't convey our message as effectively.

## The Infrequent Use Case

For those unfamiliar with the concept of virtual reality, the slogan might require further explanation.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this proposal was created internally by the V-Sekai team with assistance from AI assistant Aria.
