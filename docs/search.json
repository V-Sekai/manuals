    "text": "Lyuma, a member of the V-Sekai team, recently attended the Godot Engine Munich 2023 conference.\nShaders or MonoBehaviors/scripts are not currently supported. This will not be part of the initial release. The goal for now is scene / character / animation conversion.\nAnimationTree uses the standalone runtime/anim_tree.gd script as a blackboard system to simulate unity parameters. This file should remain.\nUnidot Importer Github Link\nA wild spooky dev snapshot appears! 👻 🎃 Contributors are making great progress on solving regressions in Godot 4.2! This new 4.2 beta 4 should be significantly more stable and reliable to upgrade 4.1 projects (not perfect yet though!). Godot Engine Dev snapshot: Godot 4.2 beta 4 We continue iterating quickly on beta snapshots for Godot 4.2 to ensure that we can solve regressions before the stable release."

    "text": "Moved issues into the tracker.\n\n\nWorked with manifold csg library author and was able to remove the boost dependency. https://github.com/elalish/manifold/pull/92\nAlso published a first draft on a Godot Engine master branch. See the issue for details.\n\n\n\nLyuma\nMade a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot’s node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.\nTo this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.\n(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)\nPushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.\nThis has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! @iFire\nMade some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else.\n\n\n\n\nRestore fix-save-as-binary so we can export projects\nRestore elixir shared branch so we can run godot in elixir\nPoked ludwig about diffusion net for machine learning training.\n\n\n\n\nFBX2GLTF and Blender importers are merged.\n\n\n\niFire\n\nMade a bug report for Blender exported animation to gltf with @RockyMadio https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1613 GitHub"

It also can launch v-sekai with openxr.\nThe builds are ranging to 10 minutes for a partially cached build on average. Engine builds take longer.\nhttps://nightly.link/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/workflows/vsk_linux_builds/main\n\n\n\nSomeone wanted me to help out on voip so I assisted\nA v-tuber, expiredpopsicle, is using godot-vrm! and contributed.\nFaolan is a Godot contribtor. Fire gifted libgodot code to him and now he’s able to run his vr platform on the Meta Quest with dotnet.\n\n\n\n\nI reduced iteration times on the V-Sekai cicd from 1.5 hours to 2-10 minutes.\nI also stopped merging incomplete work.

We got quite a lot of demand to make the GLTF importer part of core, given it is needed for VR and other stuff, so I have the feeling we should optimize it for performance (which we should do anyway) and have an option to load actual meshes instead of EditorImporterMesh.. so that means we would need to provide a function to parse the mesh node into a scene node and the editor supplies, otherwise it uses Mesh as a default\n2021-09-07 18:32:54Z fire: Miku Base Textures https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884868837978288178/unknown.png\n2021-09-07 18:02:00Z fire: Miku Miku Dance now split into materials. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884861074648760380/unknown.png 👍 (2)\n2021-09-07 16:39:33Z トカゲ: “fixed skinning https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52462”\n2021-09-07 05:53:14Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884677671563460639/unknown.png\n2021-09-07 02:10:09Z fire: Trying to write down steps to make a V-Sekai/godot update\n2021-09-06 00:25:10Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884232728839606284/kaitai_mmd_pmx.zip\n2021-09-06 00:24:45Z fire: https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/pull/446 Lyuma Thanks to Hakanai I can now generate mmd_pmx c++/stl via & 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\kaitai-struct-compiler\\bin\\kaitai-struct-compiler.bat' --cpp-standard=11 --target=cpp_stl .\\3d\\mmd_pmx.ksy -I=. --cpp-namespace kaitai_mmd_pmx Also glb binary has a parser for read and write too.

Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won’t quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest.

    "title": "Avoiding the O(n^n) State Update Problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Avoiding the O(n^n) State Update Problem\nThe O(n^n) state update problem arises when every change in state requires updating all other states, leading to an exponential increase in computations as the number of states (n) increases. This can be a significant issue in a VR environment with many interactive objects and players.\nTo avoid this problem, we can use the following strategies:\n\n1. Incremental State Updates\nAs mentioned earlier, when an avatar interacts with an object like a chair, only the relevant changes to the state are recorded and sent to the server. This means that instead of updating the entire state for every interaction, we only modify the parts of the state that have changed.\nserver.put(chair_path, %{occupied: true, occupied_by: avatar_id})\nserver.put(avatar_path, %{sitting: true, sitting_on: chair_id})\nThis approach significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and transmitted, making it much more efficient.\n\n\n2. Event-Driven Updates\nInstead of continuously updating all states, we can use an event-driven model where updates are triggered by specific events. For example, when an avatar sits on a chair, an event is triggered which updates the states of the avatar and the chair. This way, we only perform updates when necessary, reducing the computational load.\n\n\n3. Spatial Partitioning\nIn a large VR environment, not all objects interact with each other. We can divide the environment into smaller regions or partitions, and only update the states within the same partition. This technique, known as spatial partitioning, can greatly reduce the number of state updates required.\n\n\n4. Prioritizing Updates\nNot all state updates are equally important. Some updates might have a bigger impact on the game than others. By prioritizing updates based on their importance, we can ensure that the most critical updates are processed first, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the game.\nBy using these strategies, we can avoid the O(n^n) state update problem and ensure that our VR environment remains scalable and efficient, even as the number of players and interactions increases."

This is achieved through various means:\n\nProgressive Difficulty: Early levels are relatively straightforward, allowing players to learn the basic mechanics and controls of the game.\nSkill-Based Challenges: Obstacles that require certain skills to overcome.\nRewarding Exploration: Hidden areas or secret paths might contain power-ups or abilities to help players in future challenges.\nBoss Battles: Placed at the end of levels or sections, these act as tests of the skills and abilities players have gained throughout the level."

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a virtual reality (VR) platform that offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This proposal aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. These challenges affect the usability and variety of experiences for the users. To overcome these challenges and enhance the V-Sekai user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n\nWe propose focusing on Generating More Worlds as the first step towards enhancing V-Sekai. By creating new VR worlds within V-Sekai, users will have a wider range of experiences to explore. This involves designing and implementing new environments to expand the options available. With more worlds to choose from, users will have increased engagement and longer sessions within the V-Sekai platform.\n\n\n\n\nTo generate more worlds for V-Sekai, we will follow a comprehensive strategy that includes the following steps:\n\nIdentify User Preferences: Understand the target audience and their preferences. Research popular VR themes, genres, and settings to get an idea of what users would enjoy.\nDesign New Environments: Use 3D modeling software like Blender or Unity to design new virtual environments for V-Sekai. Consider creating diverse worlds like fantasy realms, futuristic cities, natural landscapes, or historical settings.\nImplement Interactive Elements: Make the new worlds interactive by adding objects, characters, and elements that users can engage with. This can include non-playable characters (NPCs), puzzles, hidden items, or mini-games within each world.\nTest and Refine: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new worlds are visually appealing, optimized for performance, and provide a seamless VR experience. Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements based on their suggestions.\nIntegrate with V-Sekai: Once the new worlds are ready, integrate them into the V-Sekai platform. Ensure they are easily accessible through the menus or navigation system within V-Sekai’s VR interface.\nRelease and Promote: Launch the updated version of V-Sekai with the newly generated worlds. Promote the release through various channels, such as social media, gaming forums, Virtual Reality communities, and V-Sekai’s official website.\n\nBy following this strategy, we will not only address the current limitations but also create an engaging and immersive VR experience for V-Sekai users.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased user engagement: The availability of more worlds will provide users with greater options to explore, leading to longer sessions and increased immersion in V-Sekai.\nExpanded user base: With a wider range of experiences, V-Sekai will attract new users who are looking for diverse VR environments.\nPositive word-of-mouth: Satisfied users will share their experiences with others, generating positive reviews and recommendations for V-Sekai.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment complexity: Creating new worlds requires significant effort and resources, including 3D modeling, programming, and testing. This may lead to increased development time and costs.\nUpfront investment: Generating more worlds will require upfront investment in terms of design, implementation, and integration with V-Sekai.\nUser feedback and iteration: Continuous user feedback is crucial to refine and improve the new worlds. This iterative process may extend the development timeline.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative solution that was considered was Integrating Backend Services. This would involve improving the backend infrastructure of V-Sekai to enhance scalability, performance, and reliability. However, after careful consideration, we prioritize generating more worlds as it directly addresses user experience limitations and provides tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and appeal.\n\n\n\nThe generation of more worlds is within the core capabilities of our team at V-Sekai. We have experienced 3D designers, developers, and testers who are skilled in creating immersive VR environments. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to execute this proposed solution effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect of this proposal, please feel free to ask."

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Bioblaze Payne, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a project that aims to provide an immersive virtual world experience for users. As the project grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and can handle various scenarios. One of the challenges faced by the V-Sekai team is the lack of diverse and realistic data for testing purposes. This limitation hinders the ability to identify potential issues and optimize the system’s performance.\n\n\n\nTo address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.\n\n\nWe will use a tool like Chance.js library to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.\n\n\nFor generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.sentence();\nReference: Chance.js Sentence\n\n\n\nFor generating random user names, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.name();\nReference: Chance.js Name\n\n\n\nWe will perform the following SQL operations on the user and chat tables:\n\nSELECT All Data in Table\nSELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%\nSELECT Specific Row Data\nINSERT\nUPDATE\nDELETE\n\n\n\nTable user\nid | username | password | updated_on | created_on |\nTable chat\nid | user_id | name | text | updated_on | deleted_on | created_on |\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return ‘OK’. We will also check if the query returned is ‘OK’ and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.\nThe implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved testing capabilities with diverse and realistic data\nEnhanced system reliability due to thorough testing\nIdentification of potential issues before they impact users\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional development time required to implement the solution\nPotential increase in storage requirements for generated data\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing static test data: This option was considered for simplicity, but it would not provide the diverse and realistic data needed for thorough testing.\nManual data generation: This option involved manually creating test data, but it was deemed time-consuming and inefficient compared to using a library like Chance.js.\nThird-party data generation services: While there are external services that can generate random text data, using them would introduce dependencies and potential costs. Implementing our a solution similar to Chance.js allows for better control over the process.\nCrowdsourcing test data: This option involved gathering test data from users or volunteers. However, it raised concerns about data privacy, consistency, and quality.\n\n\n\n\nNo, this enhancement is essential for thorough testing and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, addressing the V-Sekai limitation is crucial for ensuring the system’s reliability and performance. Implementing this solution internally allows for better control over the testing process and data generation.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused).

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, iPad, Presentation Screen, Compatibility\n\n\n\n\nWe are developing a VR game that MUST be compatible with a wide range of devices. Our goal is to make our VR game accessible and enjoyable for this vast majority of users.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to ensure the game’s user interface and controls work seamlessly across these different display sizes and touch interfaces.\n\n\n\nWe considered two options: Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices and Navmesh and 3D navigation points. We chose the “Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices” because it addresses the core issue of ensuring compatibility with iPads and large projector screens, and it is more cost-effective.\n\n\n\n\nImproved user experience across different devices and screen sizes.\nIncreased versatility of the game, making it suitable for various applications.\nEnhanced navigation in 3D spaces.\nMore cost-effective solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential increase in development time and costs.\nAdditional resources for testing on different devices and screens.\n\n\n\n\nNavmeshes and 3D Navigation Points are tools used to define traversable spaces in a 3D environment.

Each stage builds upon the previous one, gradually expanding the project’s scope and capabilities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\n\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[Avatar Loading] --&gt; B1[Simple Demo with VRM Avatar]\n    A --&gt; B2[VRM & Unity Import - Maintain and Improve]\n    A --&gt; B3[Network Code Reconciliation - Godot Network System]\n    A --&gt; B4[Jitter in Network Interpolation]\n    A --&gt; B5[Implement jitter and playback buffer for Voice]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Mid Term\n    B4 --&gt; C[Network]\n    C --&gt; D1[Entity System & Background Loading]\n    C --&gt; D2[Background Loading - Re-evaluate with Multithreaded Scene Tree]\n    C --&gt; D3[UI Work - Fix VR UI & Improve Interaction]\n    C --&gt; D4[Lightweight Relay Instance Server - Single Process, Multiple Instances]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Long Term\n    D4 --&gt; E[Scalable Instances]\n    E --&gt; F1[Network Topology Implementation]\n    E --&gt; F2[Streamlined Content Creation - Better Workflow]\n    E --&gt; F3[Zero Stutter when Loading Content - Address Bottlenecks]\n    E --&gt; F4[Social and Upload Features - Enhance User Experience]\n    E --&gt; F5[Video and Audio Work - Streaming Integration]\n    E --&gt; F6[Scripting Integrations - WASM-based Scripts]\n    E --&gt; F7[UX Work for Non-Technical Users - Accessible UI]\n    E --&gt; F8[Loading VRM Avatars - Streamlined Process]\n    E --&gt; F9[In-Editor Content Building UX - Non-Technical Users]\n  end\nThe discussion involves the development of V-Sekai, a project with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In the short term, the focus is on avatar loading, simple demos, VRM & Unity import, network code reconciliation, adding network interpolation, and voice jitter buffer. Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.\nOne challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.\nIn addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.\nIt’s important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo. This is a process.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "title": "Proposed: Character Customization Discord Bot PoC for V-Sekai",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, Character Customization, Discord Bot, PoC\n\n\n\n\nWithin the V-Sekai community, there is a desire to enhance user engagement through interactive tools that allow for creative expression. The community seeks to leverage Discord as a platform to introduce such tools.\n\n\n\nThe current challenge is to create an interactive Discord bot that allows for immersive character customization, aligning with V-Sekai’s vision of fostering a creative and engaged community.\n\n\n\nTo create a Discord bot as a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the feasibility of character customization using trait-based input, we will execute the following steps:\n\nDefine Key Traits: We will select a set of fundamental character traits such as height, body shape, hair color, and clothing style. Each trait will be associated with a Unicode emoji for straightforward identification and interaction within the Discord interface.\nBot Development: A bot will be developed to parse textual commands linked to each trait. For example, a user might input !height 📏 to set the character’s height or !hair 🎨 to choose a hair color.\nImage Generation: The bot will map each trait to a specific set of 2D image assets. It will have the logic to composite these assets into a single image that represents the character based on the selected traits.\nUser Interaction: Reaction buttons for ‘like’ 👍, ‘dislike’ 👎, and ‘regenerate’ 🔄 will be implemented to allow users to interact with the generated character. This will provide immediate feedback mechanisms for the community.\nTesting and Iteration: The bot will be deployed in a controlled Discord environment and tested by real users. Their feedback will be crucial for refining the bot’s functionality and user experience.\nDocumentation: All development processes, user interactions, and iterations will be thoroughly documented. This documentation will be critical for understanding user needs and will inform future development cycles.\n\nThis PoC will serve to validate the core idea, engage the user community early in the development process, and provide critical insights for scaling the bot to handle more complex trait manipulation and 3D character rendering in future phases.\n\n\n\nImplementing this bot will potentially increase community engagement by providing a fun and interactive character creation tool. It will also lay the foundation for future developments in VR and character design within the V-Sekai ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe initial development of the bot may require significant resources and there is a risk of low user adoption. Additionally, ensuring the bot’s scalability and handling user feedback for improvements could be challenging.\n\n\n\nAlternatives, such as outsourcing the tool or purchasing an existing solution, were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of in-house development to retain creative control and better integration with V-Sekai’s infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThere might be less frequent use cases for the bot, such as character customization for one-time events or non-regular users. The bot’s design will need to account for these to ensure it remains relevant and accessible.\n\n\n\nThe core functionality of the bot aligns with V-Sekai’s objectives and values. The development will be handled internally to ensure the tool’s compatibility with the community’s needs and expectations.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai Official Website - Community of enthusiasts building a next-generation social and gaming VR platform powered by the Godot Engine 4.0\nNousResearch Yarn Mistral 7b 128k - Hugging Face - A Hugging Face Space by realgenius\nIssue #68 · polygonjs/polygonjs - GitHub - Discussion on using polygon.js as a Discord webhook watcher to output messages and attachments\n\nThis article was assisted by AI."

    "text": "To create a Discord bot as a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the feasibility of character customization using trait-based input, we will execute the following steps:\n\nDefine Key Traits: We will select a set of fundamental character traits such as height, body shape, hair color, and clothing style. Each trait will be associated with a Unicode emoji for straightforward identification and interaction within the Discord interface.\nBot Development: A bot will be developed to parse textual commands linked to each trait. For example, a user might input !height 📏 to set the character’s height or !hair 🎨 to choose a hair color.\nImage Generation: The bot will map each trait to a specific set of 2D image assets. It will have the logic to composite these assets into a single image that represents the character based on the selected traits.\nUser Interaction: Reaction buttons for ‘like’ 👍, ‘dislike’ 👎, and ‘regenerate’ 🔄 will be implemented to allow users to interact with the generated character. This will provide immediate feedback mechanisms for the community.\nTesting and Iteration: The bot will be deployed in a controlled Discord environment and tested by real users. Their feedback will be crucial for refining the bot’s functionality and user experience.\nDocumentation: All development processes, user interactions, and iterations will be thoroughly documented. This documentation will be critical for understanding user needs and will inform future development cycles.\n\nThis PoC will serve to validate the core idea, engage the user community early in the development process, and provide critical insights for scaling the bot to handle more complex trait manipulation and 3D character rendering in future phases."

This can be achieved by using the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0.\n\n\n\nThe proposed solution involves using the T5 model to generate text based on input text and then converting the generated text into XState JSON format, all within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.\n\n\n\nTo use T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0, you’ll need to follow these steps:\n\nLoad the necessary libraries\n\nvar transformers = preload(\"res://path/to/transformers.gd\")\nvar torch = preload(\"res://path/to/torch.gd\")\n\nLoad the T5 model and tokenizer\n\nvar model_name = \"t5-small\"\nvar tokenizer = transformers.load_T5Tokenizer(model_name)\nvar model = transformers.load_T5ForConditionalGeneration(model_name)\n\nCreate a function to generate text using T5\n\nfunc generate_text(input_text: String) -&gt; String:\n    var input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text)\n    var outputs = model.generate(input_ids)\n    var generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\n    return generated_text\n\nCreate a function to replace placeholders in T5 output\n\nfunc replace_placeholders(text: String) -&gt; String:\n    var formatted_text = text.replace(\"&lt;extra_id_0&gt;\", \"event\").replace(\"&lt;extra_id_1&gt;\", \"state\")\n    return formatted_text\n\nCreate a function to parse JSON from formatted text\n\nfunc parse_JSON(formatted_text: String) -&gt; Dictionary:\n    var json_object = JSON.parse(formatted_text).result\n    return json_object\n\nCreate a function to convert T5 output to XState JSON format\n\nfunc t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(text: String) -&gt; Dictionary:\n    var formatted_text = replace_placeholders(text)\n    var json_object = parse_JSON(formatted_text)\n    return json_object\n\nUse the functions to generate XState JSON\n\nfunc _ready():\n    var input_text = \"your input text here\"\n    var t5_output = generate_text(input_text)\n    var xstate_json = t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(t5_output)\n    print(xstate_json)\nThis will give you the XState JSON format for the given input text.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, ellenhp, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, ai assisted\n\n\n\n\nThe problem of simulating audio reverb in Godot Engine 4 involves accurately modeling the way sound waves propagate, reflect, and interact within a given environment. This requires sampling a chaotic 7-dimensional space every frame, either through precomputation or real-time processing. The complexity arises from the fact that sound behaves more like light with intense diffraction, making it impossible to rasterize.\n\n\n\nImplement Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation. FDNs consist of multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix. The output is a combination of the input signal and the delayed signals.\n\n\n\nChoose the number of delay lines and their lengths based on the desired reverberation time and room characteristics.\nImplement a mixing matrix to control the energy distribution between the delay lines.\nCreate a feedback loop by connecting the outputs of the delay lines to the inputs through the mixing matrix.\nCombine the input signal with the delayed signals to produce the reverberated output.\n\n\n\n\n\nclass_name FDN\nextends Node\n\nvar num_delay_lines : int\nvar delay_lines : Array\nvar mixing_matrix : Array\nvar room_characteristics : Dictionary\n\nfunc _init(num_delay_lines: int, delay_lengths: Array, mixing_matrix: Array, room_characteristics: Dictionary):\n    self.num_delay_lines = num_delay_lines\n    self.delay_lines = []\n    for length in delay_lengths:\n        self.delay_lines.append(DelayLine.new(length))\n    self.mixing_matrix = mixing_matrix\n    self.room_characteristics = room_characteristics\n\nfunc process(input_signal: float) -&gt; float:\n    # Step 1: Calculate the output of each delay line\n    var delay_outputs = []\n    for dl in self.delay_lines:\n        delay_outputs.append(dl.process(input_signal))\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the room characteristics to the delay line outputs\n    var processed_outputs = apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the mixing matrix to the processed delay line outputs\n    var mixed_outputs = apply_mixing_matrix(processed_outputs)\n\n    # Step 4: Update the delay lines with the mixed outputs\n    for i in range(self.num_delay_lines):\n        self.delay_lines[i].update(mixed_outputs[i])\n\n    # Step 5: Combine the input signal with the delayed signals\n    var output_signal = input_signal + sum(mixed_outputs)\n    return output_signal\n\nfunc apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs: Array) -&gt; Array:\n    var processed_outputs = []\n    for i in range(len(delay_outputs)):\n        processed_output = delay_outputs[i] * room_characteristics[\"absorption\"][i]\n        processed_outputs.append(processed_output)\n    return processed_outputs\n\nfunc apply_mixing_matrix(delay_outputs: Array) -&gt; Array:\n    # TODO: Implement the mixing matrix application logic\n    pass\n\n\n\n\nImproved audio reverb simulation\nMore realistic sound propagation and interaction within environments\nSmarter estimation of long reverb times\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased computational complexity\nPotential performance impact on real-time processing\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dijkstra Pathfinding\nDWN (Digital Waveguide Network): A method for simulating audio reverb by modeling sound propagation as waves traveling along waveguides with bidirectional delay lines and scattering junctions.\nRay tracing can be used to simulate sound propagation in 3D environments. It involves casting rays from the sound source and tracing their paths as they interact with the environment (reflect, refract, and diffract). By calculating the time delay and attenuation of each ray reaching the listener, you can generate an impulse response that represents the acoustic properties of the space.\nConvolution reverb is a technique that uses recorded impulse responses (IRs) of real spaces or digital simulations to recreate the reverberation characteristics of those spaces. The process involves convolving the dry audio signal with the impulse response to produce the reverberated audio.\n\n\n\n\nNo, implementing FDNs requires a more complex algorithm and cannot be achieved with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, as it directly impacts the audio experience within V-Sekai environments, it should be a core feature to ensure consistent and high-quality audio reverb simulation.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: A virtual reality platform that allows users to create and explore immersive environments.\nGodot Engine 4: An open-source game engine used for creating 2D and 3D games and interactive applications.\nAudio Reverb: The persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound has stopped, caused by reflections off surfaces within the environment.\nFeedback Delay Networks (FDNs): A method for simulating artificial reverberation using multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix.\nDelay Line: A digital signal processing technique that introduces a time delay to an input signal, often used in audio effects such as reverb and echo.\nMixing Matrix: A mathematical construct used to control the energy distribution between the delay lines in an FDN.\nRoom Characteristics: Acoustic properties of a room or environment, such as absorption, reflection, and diffusion, which affect how sound propagates within the space.\nReverberation Time: The time it takes for the sound level in a room to decrease by 60 decibels after the sound source has stopped.\nDigital Waveguide Network (DWN): An alternative method for simulating audio reverb by modeling sound propagation as waves traveling along waveguides with bidirectional delay lines and scattering junctions.\nRay Tracing: A technique used to simulate sound propagation in 3D environments by casting rays from the sound source and tracing their paths as they interact with the environment (reflect, refract, and diffract).\nConvolution Reverb: A technique that uses recorded impulse responses (IRs) of real spaces or digital simulations to recreate the reverberation characteristics of those spaces by convolving the dry audio signal with the impulse response.\nImpulse Response (IR): A recording or simulation of the acoustic properties of a space, used in convolution reverb to recreate the reverberation characteristics of that space.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider an example of implementing a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) for audio reverb simulation with 8 delay lines. We will analyze the computational and I/O complexity involved in this specific case.\n\n\n\nFor a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN.\nFor an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.\n\n\n\n\nFor a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN. The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:\n\nDelay Lines: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nMatrix Mixing: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nFeedback and Input/Output Processing: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\nReading and Writing Delay Line Buffers: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nInput and Output Audio Data: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware."

The current architecture of the skinning and blend shapes #animation is like vertex #animation fed by buffers, but the keyframe playback is also problematic\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nI care about this more than other core contributors.\n\n\nReferences\nNo response\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,humbletim,codefloof,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nBuild Gltf extensions. Why build incomplete Gltf extensions with limited usefulness without the complete package? We should be making for creators, not ourselves.\n\n\n\nhumbletim, codefloof, iFire and lyuma debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn’t unknown and is unknown.\nLyuma can’t entirely agree that Gltf extensions are “separated.” Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn’t something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others.

    "text": "humbletim, codefloof, iFire and lyuma debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn’t unknown and is unknown.\nLyuma can’t entirely agree that Gltf extensions are “separated.” Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn’t something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others. Lyuma agrees that this is valid; other formats could be deemed “interoperable,” more expressive than Gltf.\nIn Lyuma’s mind, it’s a fair X point that already exists. So why work on Y? Why does Gltf 3d format if we have Fbx 3d format etc.?\nLyuma doesn’t think we need to assume that there must be only one standard.\nWe’re trying to see if we can do better by working together than taking some existing closed format and using it verbatim.\nOMI work is valid even if a unity package standard exists.

While this approach allows for easier updates and maintenance, it can be more complex to set up and manage compared to git subrepo.\nCreating a separate plugin: Develop the PMX module as a standalone plugin that users can install and enable in their projects. This option reduces the complexity of the core V-Sekai project but may result in less seamless integration and increased setup effort for users.\nForking the Godot Engine: Fork the entire Godot Engine and directly modify its source code to include the PMX module.

    "text": "Manual integration of the PMX module: Instead of using git subrepo, manually copy and integrate the PMX module into the V-Sekai project. This option is less efficient and harder to maintain, as it requires manual updates and synchronization with the original PMX repository.\nUsing Git Submodules: Use git submodule to include the PMX module in the V-Sekai project. While this approach allows for easier updates and maintenance, it can be more complex to set up and manage compared to git subrepo.\nCreating a separate plugin: Develop the PMX module as a standalone plugin that users can install and enable in their projects. This option reduces the complexity of the core V-Sekai project but may result in less seamless integration and increased setup effort for users.\nForking the Godot Engine: Fork the entire Godot Engine and directly modify its source code to include the PMX module. This option is not recommended, as it would make it difficult to keep the fork updated with upstream changes and could lead to compatibility issues."

    "text": "Thunderbolt Driver Issue Solution\nTo all who end up in this thread, as I did. Welcome\nAnother user in this thread had a solution that worked for me, so I will repeat it with a more detailed explanation.\nCredit to “Johnatan” on page 3\nThe issue is that the new Thunderbolt drivers fail to remove and overwrite the old drivers. The problem can be resolved through the device manager.\nRight-click on “Start” (the Windows icon at the corner of your taskbar) and select “Device Manager.”\nWithin the device manager, open the category “System Devices.”\nScroll down to Thunderbolt(TM) Controller - (model number here)\n*Right-click on it, select “Uninstall Device,” and check the box “Delete the driver software for this device.”\nOnce removed, rerun the Thunderbolt installer or the update through the Dell Command Updater.\n*If you are worried about uninstalling the driver in the device manager, fret not. The driver will reinstall itself on reboot if you have an internet connection."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: rejected\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire, antpb\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nThe VRM format is becoming increasingly popular in the field of 3D modeling and animation. It allows for easy sharing and transfer of humanoid 3D models with skeletal animations between different software applications. One such application is the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine.\n\n\n\nCurrently, developers working with VRM files in Godot Engine face difficulties when trying to convert these files to Blender format for further editing or manipulation. Manual conversion processes can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n\n\nThe proposed strategy for enabling VRM to Blender conversion involves leveraging the computational power of cloud GPUs provided by replicate.com. By running a GPU-accelerated Blender instance, developers can perform an identity operation on the VRM input, converting it to Blender format. This simplifies the process of converting VRM files to Blender format.\nTo convert VRM files to Blender format, developers can follow these steps:\n\nInstall the necessary libraries or plugins in Blender that support the VRM format.\nLeverage replicate.com’s infrastructure to spin up a GPU-accelerated Blender instance.\nDevelop a script or tool that takes the VRM file as input and sends it to the GPU-accelerated Blender instance via a REST interface.\nIn the GPU-accelerated Blender instance, use the installed libraries or plugins to perform the conversion from VRM to Blender format.\nAlso use Blender to perform the conversion from Blender to VRM/GLTF format.\n\nThis strategy streamlines the workflow for developers, saving time and improving collaboration between designers and developers. The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com’s infrastructure ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\nAdditionally, this strategy can also be extended to other software applications or websites that can utilize a REST interface, allowing developers working with VRM files to convert them to Blender format seamlessly, regardless of the software they are using.\n\n\n\n\nStreamlined workflow: Developers can easily convert VRM files to Blender format, opening up a wide range of editing and manipulation possibilities.\nTime-saving: The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com’s infrastructure ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\nImproved collaboration: The ability to work with VRM models in both Godot Engine and Blender facilitates collaboration between designers and developers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment effort and expertise: Creating the necessary library or plugin may require significant technical knowledge in both the Godot Engine and VRM format.\nCompatibility issues: Different versions of FBX or GLB files may introduce compatibility challenges during the conversion process.\nMaintenance challenges: Keeping up with future updates to the Godot Engine and VRM specifications may require ongoing effort.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered developing a web application, but it was deemed to have heavy engineering costs.\n\n\n\nWhile the proposed solution focuses on streamlining VRM to Blender conversion for the Godot Engine ecosystem, the same concept can be extended to other software applications or websites that can utilize a REST interface. This allows developers working with VRM files to convert them to Blender format seamlessly, regardless of the software they are using. The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com’s infrastructure still ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\n\n\n\nFire knows the way.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nVRM Animation Specification\nReplicate - Cloud GPU Toy\n\nThis article is assisted by AI.\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?"

By running a GPU-accelerated Blender instance, developers can perform an identity operation on the VRM input, converting it to Blender format. This simplifies the process of converting VRM files to Blender format.\nTo convert VRM files to Blender format, developers can follow these steps:\n\nInstall the necessary libraries or plugins in Blender that support the VRM format.\nLeverage replicate.com’s infrastructure to spin up a GPU-accelerated Blender instance.\nDevelop a script or tool that takes the VRM file as input and sends it to the GPU-accelerated Blender instance via a REST interface.\nIn the GPU-accelerated Blender instance, use the installed libraries or plugins to perform the conversion from VRM to Blender format.\nAlso use Blender to perform the conversion from Blender to VRM/GLTF format.\n\nThis strategy streamlines the workflow for developers, saving time and improving collaboration between designers and developers. The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com’s infrastructure ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\nAdditionally, this strategy can also be extended to other software applications or websites that can utilize a REST interface, allowing developers working with VRM files to convert them to Blender format seamlessly, regardless of the software they are using."

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, Chatbot GPT4 assistance\n\n\n\n\nEnable creation of more dynamic and engaging environments within V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai, an open-source virtual reality platform, aims to deliver a user-friendly experience for the VR community. To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\nTo further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai’s capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.\nThe implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant MembraneFramework\n  participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  participant ElixirNx\n  participant AIMLFramework\n  participant Yugabyte\n\n  rect rgb(240, 248, 255)\n    note over MembraneFramework, Yugabyte: Toggle Actions\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient: TOGGLE_GAME_ENGINE_AND_CLIENTS\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;ElixirNx: ACCELERATE_MEMBRANE_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;AIMLFramework: TOGGLE_AIML_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;Yugabyte: TOGGLE_YUGABYTE\n  end\n\n  box \"Source\" #CCFFCC\n    participant MembraneFramework\n    participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  end\n\n  box \"Filter\" #FFFFCC\n    participant ElixirNx\n    participant AIMLFramework\n  end\n\n  box \"Sink & Source of Data\" #FFCCCC\n    participant Yugabyte\n  end\n\n\nWe propose using read replicas for applications needing single-zone writes and multi-region reads. Benefits include:\n\nResilience: Zone-level resilience with primary cluster nodes across multiple zones.\nConsistency: Timeline consistency in replica clusters, better than eventual consistency.\nLatency: Quick reads from primary and replica clusters; write latency depends on client-primary cluster distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved functionality and versatility of V-Sekai\nEnhanced compatibility with other tools and platforms\nGreater potential for collaboration and community involvement\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased complexity in implementation and maintenance\nPotential performance overhead due to integration of multiple components\n\n\n\n\n\nStandalone procedural generation: Implementing procedural generation as a standalone feature without integrating it with the Godot Engine server. This option was discarded because it would not provide the same level of compatibility and versatility as the proposed solution.\nUsing pre-built assets: Relying on pre-built assets for creating environments instead of implementing networked procedural generation. This option was discarded due to the limited flexibility and potential for repetitive content, which could negatively impact user engagement.\nThird-party procedural generation tools: Integrating third-party procedural generation tools instead of developing a custom solution. This option was discarded because it may not offer the same level of control and customization required for V-Sekai’s specific needs.\nStatic environment design: Focusing on static environment design rather than dynamic, procedurally generated content. This option was discarded because it would not provide the desired level of immersion and interactivity for V-Sekai users.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the proposed solution involves integrating multiple technologies and cannot be achieved with a simple script workaround.\n\n\n\nYes, addressing the limitations of V-Sekai is crucial for its success and adoption within the VR community. By integrating the proposed technologies, we can ensure that V-Sekai remains competitive and relevant in the rapidly evolving VR landscape.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Standalone procedural generation: Implementing procedural generation as a standalone feature without integrating it with the Godot Engine server. This option was discarded because it would not provide the same level of compatibility and versatility as the proposed solution.\nUsing pre-built assets: Relying on pre-built assets for creating environments instead of implementing networked procedural generation. This option was discarded due to the limited flexibility and potential for repetitive content, which could negatively impact user engagement.\nThird-party procedural generation tools: Integrating third-party procedural generation tools instead of developing a custom solution. This option was discarded because it may not offer the same level of control and customization required for V-Sekai’s specific needs.\nStatic environment design: Focusing on static environment design rather than dynamic, procedurally generated content. This option was discarded because it would not provide the desired level of immersion and interactivity for V-Sekai users."

How can we improve the workflow to better maintain the project’s organization and compatibility?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nImplement a Git subrepo management system to separate assets and libraries, enabling easier tracking and synchronization between branches. This solution streamlines the development proces\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nConfigure the Git subrepo to automatically update and synchronize with the main project.\nUse the Git subrepo in each branch to maintain consistent asset and library versions.\nAvoid storing godot and modules inside of the v-sekai-game.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved organization and compatibility of assets and libraries across branches.\nSimplified workflow for project updates and synchronization.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nPotential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Git subrepo management.\nPossible limitations in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nWorkarounds using scripts may be possible, but they are likely to be less efficient and more prone to errors compared to a Git subrepo management system.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a few lines of code. It is also devops.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIntegrating a Git subrepo management system as a core feature ensures consistency and maintainability across the entire V-Sekai project. It promotes better collaboration among team members and streamlines the development process.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nGit Subrepo Documentation"

We aim to contribute to social VR and provide alternatives to proprietary engines like Unity and Unreal.\nDespite challenges, we’ve grown into a global community committed to advancing open standards and open-source software for virtual worlds.\nOur strategy focuses on providing comprehensive documentation and support to help users understand the platform better. We’re also committed to investigating and resolving issues like the reported Linux build problem.\n\n\n\nOver the past month, our team has been deeply involved in the Godot Engine conference in Munich, Germany. Our primary responsibility during this period has been to prepare for the upcoming launch of Godot Engine 4.2, to which we are contributing as part of the animation and 3D pipeline teams.\n\n\n\nWhat state is V-Sekai in, and what can it do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplayer Voice Chat: The multiplayer voice chat feature in V-Sekai is broken.\nMenu Editing: In V-Sekai, menus can’t be edited in VR. They can only be edited on the desktop before entering a game.\nDefault Avatar IK: V-Sekai’s default ik is currently twisted incorrectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvatar Uploading and Downloading: V-Sekai can upload from the editor and, download avatars, and load them into the game at runtime.\nWorld Uploading and Downloading: V-Sekai can upload from the editor and, download worlds, and load them into the game at runtime.\nVR Mode Loading: V-Sekai can successfully load in VR mode.\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions: V-Sekai is actively looking for more contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:\nAddressing these challenges can enhance the user experience, boost platform adoption, and collect crucial feedback for subsequent development.\nCons:\nThere may be underlying issues causing the Linux build problem that could take significant time and resources to resolve.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach could have been to ignore the user’s query and continue with the current development roadmap. However, this would not foster a supportive community or encourage user engagement.\n\n\n\nWhile most users may not encounter the same issue as PLYSHKA🐧, addressing even infrequent use cases is essential to ensure a robust and user-friendly platform.\n\n\n\nAddressing this issue falls within our core responsibilities as the V-Sekai development team.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\n\nAI Aria assisted with this article."

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nMeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.\n\n\n\nAdapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain is a challenge. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.\n\n\n\nThe MeshRWKV model employs a sequence-based approach that autoregressively generates triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two primary steps:\n\n\nThe initial step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This enables the encoding and decoding of triangles from this embedding.\nA graph convolution encoder, specifically a series of SAGE-Conv graph convolution layers, is utilized in this process. This encoder processes the mesh in the form of a face graph. For each graph node, input features include the positionally encoded 9 coordinates of the face triangle, its area, the angles between its edges, and the normal of the face.\nThese geometrically rich features capture the intricate details of 3D shapes and are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization. This effectively reduces the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.\nThese embeddings are then sequenced and decoded by a 1D ResNet-34 network, which interprets the face features as a 1D sequence. It outputs logits corresponding to the 9 discrete coordinates of each face triangle. The size of the codebook C and the discretization space are determined based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.\nOnce trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.\n\n\n\nMeshGPT has made significant strides in the field of direct mesh generation, but it is not without its limitations. The autoregressive nature of the model results in slower sampling performance, with mesh generation times ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. The MeshGPT team’s learned tokenization approach has been successful in reducing sequence lengths for single object generation, but it may not be as effective when applied to scene-scale generation. This presents an opportunity for future enhancement.\nFurthermore, MeshGPT’s current computational resources restrict it to using the GPT2-medium transformer, which is less sophisticated than models like Llama2. Given that larger language models tend to benefit from increased data and computational power, expanding these resources could significantly enhance MeshGPT’s performance and capabilities.\nIt’s important to note that the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model’s context size is significantly larger than that of GPT2. In machine learning, context size refers to the amount of information from previous steps that a model can consider while making predictions for the next step. It essentially determines how much ‘memory’ the model has about past data.\nThe larger context size of RWKV means that it can remember and utilize more past information while generating outputs. This feature potentially enables it to handle larger and more complex tasks, provided there are sufficient computational resources.\nHowever, a larger context size also implies higher computational demands. More processing power and memory are required to store and manage such large amounts of data. This could pose challenges in terms of hardware requirements and efficiency, particularly when dealing with very large datasets or complex tasks.\n\n\n\n\nOur approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.\n\n\n\nGiven that the MeshGPT model has already developed a process for converting mesh data into logits, this simplifies the task of applying the MeshRWKV model to skeletal animation.\nThe fundamental concept would involve representing a sequence of animation frames (from frame0 to frameN) as meshes. The recursive nature of RWKV could potentially offer significant advantages in this scenario. It might facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of sequential frames, which could lead to the generation of smooth and coherent animations.\nWith the mesh-to-logits conversion challenge addressed by MeshGPT, the primary focus can be on developing new training methodologies and loss functions tailored for animation data. This approach could significantly broaden the applicability of the MeshRWKV model, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and development in the field of 3D animation.\n\n\n\nTraining the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.\n\n\n\nOther methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.\n\n\n\nGenerating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nYes, this proposal is core to our work at V-Sekai and will be implemented by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game\nMeshGPT\nObjaverse-XL\nNous-Hermes-2-Vision\nMachine Learning in Elixir\nPyTorch Geometric SAGEConv\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs\n\nAssisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "text": "The MeshRWKV model employs a sequence-based approach that autoregressively generates triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two primary steps:\n\n\nThe initial step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This enables the encoding and decoding of triangles from this embedding.\nA graph convolution encoder, specifically a series of SAGE-Conv graph convolution layers, is utilized in this process. This encoder processes the mesh in the form of a face graph. For each graph node, input features include the positionally encoded 9 coordinates of the face triangle, its area, the angles between its edges, and the normal of the face.\nThese geometrically rich features capture the intricate details of 3D shapes and are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization. This effectively reduces the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.\nThese embeddings are then sequenced and decoded by a 1D ResNet-34 network, which interprets the face features as a 1D sequence. It outputs logits corresponding to the 9 discrete coordinates of each face triangle. The size of the codebook C and the discretization space are determined based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.\nOnce trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.\n\n\n\nMeshGPT has made significant strides in the field of direct mesh generation, but it is not without its limitations. The autoregressive nature of the model results in slower sampling performance, with mesh generation times ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. The MeshGPT team’s learned tokenization approach has been successful in reducing sequence lengths for single object generation, but it may not be as effective when applied to scene-scale generation. This presents an opportunity for future enhancement.\nFurthermore, MeshGPT’s current computational resources restrict it to using the GPT2-medium transformer, which is less sophisticated than models like Llama2. Given that larger language models tend to benefit from increased data and computational power, expanding these resources could significantly enhance MeshGPT’s performance and capabilities.\nIt’s important to note that the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model’s context size is significantly larger than that of GPT2. In machine learning, context size refers to the amount of information from previous steps that a model can consider while making predictions for the next step. It essentially determines how much ‘memory’ the model has about past data.\nThe larger context size of RWKV means that it can remember and utilize more past information while generating outputs. This feature potentially enables it to handle larger and more complex tasks, provided there are sufficient computational resources.\nHowever, a larger context size also implies higher computational demands. More processing power and memory are required to store and manage such large amounts of data. This could pose challenges in terms of hardware requirements and efficiency, particularly when dealing with very large datasets or complex tasks."

    "text": "Given that the MeshGPT model has already developed a process for converting mesh data into logits, this simplifies the task of applying the MeshRWKV model to skeletal animation.\nThe fundamental concept would involve representing a sequence of animation frames (from frame0 to frameN) as meshes. The recursive nature of RWKV could potentially offer significant advantages in this scenario. It might facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of sequential frames, which could lead to the generation of smooth and coherent animations.\nWith the mesh-to-logits conversion challenge addressed by MeshGPT, the primary focus can be on developing new training methodologies and loss functions tailored for animation data. This approach could significantly broaden the applicability of the MeshRWKV model, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and development in the field of 3D animation."

As virtual and augmented reality technologies improve, developers seek methods to integrate external skeleton data, such as OpenXR hand tracking or “full body tracking” skeletons, with existing imported and skinned meshes within the Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nThe current implementation of OpenXR provides a bone structure model for hand tracking data, which is incorporated into the Godot Engine through an OpenXRHand helper node.

    "text": "Rejected: Package Godot for pkgin\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nAccording to Netflix, the BSD-type operating systems are competitive, and supporting pkgsrc is an excellent way to start.\n\npkgsrc is a framework for managing third-party software on UNIX-like systems containing over 26,000 packages. It is the default package manager of NetBSD and SmartOS and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n\nV-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEffortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\nWider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\nPromoting cooperation: V-Sekai’s support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\nReinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai’s decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --&gt; B[Build and Package]\nB --&gt; C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --&gt; D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --&gt; E[macOS]\nD --&gt; F[Linux]\nD --&gt; G[NetBSD]\nC --&gt; H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --&gt; J[pkgin command]\nJ --&gt; H\nH --&gt; K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --&gt; I\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\nWide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\nEfficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\nUniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\nConnection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\nResource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai’s VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\nEmphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n\nOption graveyard\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform’s vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"

This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.\nWhen switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.\nYou click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nAble to mask loading times\nAble to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai\nFor style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\ncoordinating cats\nThe drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.\nIt makes for a far less friction-less experience\nBut again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional\nWe could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWorld traversal is a problem.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nThe Godot Engine is a powerful tool for creating games and other interactive content. However, finding specific pieces of code or resources within a large project can be challenging. This is where an embedding search engine like SeaGOAT can come in handy.\n\n\n\nThe challenge lies in integrating the SeaGOAT search engine with Godot Engine projects. Specifically, we need to ensure that it can effectively index and search .tscn, .tres, .gd, .cpp, .h, and .xml files, which are commonly used in Godot projects.\n\n\n\nTo use SeaGOAT with Godot Engine projects, you’ll need to add support for .tscn, .tres, .gd, .cpp, .h, and .xml files. You can do this by modifying the common.py file in the SeaGOAT repository. Specifically, you’ll want to add these extensions to the FILE_EXTENSIONS list:\nFILE_EXTENSIONS = [\n    # existing extensions...\n    \".tscn\",\n    \".tres\",\n    \".gd\",\n    \".cpp\",\n    \".h\",\n    \".xml\"\n]\nOnce you’ve done this, SeaGOAT should be able to index and search your Godot Engine projects.\n\n\n\nBy integrating SeaGOAT with your Godot Engine projects, you’ll be able to quickly and easily find specific pieces of code or resources. This can greatly speed up your development process and make it easier to manage large projects.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that this requires modifying the SeaGOAT source code, which may not be ideal if you’re not comfortable with Python or if you want to keep your SeaGOAT installation up-to-date with the official repository.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use a different search engine that already supports .tscn, .tres, .gd, .cpp, .h, and .xml files. However, this may not provide the same level of functionality as SeaGOAT.\n\n\n\nThis strategy is most useful for large Godot Engine projects where finding specific pieces of code or resources can be challenging. For smaller projects, the built-in search functionality in Godot may be sufficient.\n\n\n\nThis modification would need to be done by us, as it involves changing the SeaGOAT source code. It’s not clear whether this change would be accepted into the core SeaGOAT project.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nSeaGOAT\nThis article is assisted by AI."

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this.

So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml"

A social RPG game could be the solution, offering continuous gameplay that encourages interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur game is set in a “Comfortable Cyberprep” realm. It merges sci-fi with ease, where tech and humans coexist. Players explore a future city where technology is part of life. The city glows with neon lights, holographic interfaces, and advanced AI, yet retains homeliness.\n\nStatic couch collider: A fixed location for player interaction.\nNon-functional Static bed without collider: A rejuvenation spot for characters.\nNon-functional Mirror that is off: A decorative element with potential uses.\nNon-functional Video player screen that is off: A feature for entertainment or information.\n\n\n\n\n\nChill and hang with friends: The game provides a relaxed environment for socializing.\nPlay a game: Beyond socializing, players can engage in an RPG game.\n\n\n\n\n\nRPG game with level rewards: Players improve through play.\nCombat System: Players choose between different types of weapons or defensive items.\nStationary Target Combat System: A mechanism where players engage in combat with fixed-position targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings are not persisted past server restart.\nLimited number of weapon choices: To maintain balance.\nCooldown period for using healing items: To prevent spamming.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation details will be decided upon proposal acceptance.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased user engagement\nProlonged interaction within the V-Sekai world\nEnhanced socialization among players\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential increase in development time and resources\nRisk of unbalanced gameplay if the RPG system is not properly designed\n\n\n\n\nOptions considered but discarded:\n\nIdle RPG Mechanic: Removed due to potential decrease in active engagement from players.\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of use depends on the players’ engagement level. However, given the complexity of an RPG system, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nCreating an RPG system as a feature of V-Sekai will enhance the overall user experience and engagement, which aligns with our goal of providing a compelling virtual world.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project’s goals and priorities.\n\nHow it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nA well-organized project documentation and visual roadmap will help potential contributors understand the project’s scope and vision, allowing them to make informed decisions about contributing.\nA transparent contribution process will facilitate collaboration by providing guidelines, resources, and communication channels for contributors.\nOnboarding new contributors with tutorials and mentorship will help them quickly become productive and dedicated team members.\nRegular meetings and progress updates will keep the team motivated and focused on achieving milestones.\nRecognizing and rewarding contributors will foster a sense of community and commitment, making it more likely that they continue contributing to the project.\n\nWith these measures in place, the V-Sekai project will overcome its current limitations, making it easier for the team to work together and attract new contributors.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nDevelop a clear and concise project documentation that outlines the project’s goals, requirements, and milestones.

The proposed solution aims to create a more sustainable and efficient environment for the V-Sekai project, which cannot be achieved with a temporary workaround or a simple script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nAs the primary developers of the project, the V-Sekai team has the best understanding of the project’s goals, objectives, and priorities.

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, VR, 3D Modeling, Virtual Reality\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly growing technology with applications in various fields. One such application is the creation of virtual environments, such as apartments. This proposal aims to outline a strategy for building a cozy apartment in VR as a default environment for V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to create a realistic and immersive virtual environment that accurately represents a cozy apartment.

In particular, the dynamic_shapes and simple_embedding samples showcase how to run on your choice of target. The input program may have a signature in the stablehlo dialect, and you can use IREE or XLA depending on your preferred tech stack or runtime requirements. The Vulkan stack in IREE is relatively stable and offers good performance, with nod.ai’s SHARK offering extra tuning and APIs on top. However, there may be differences in optimization depending on the workload and potential driver bugs and pitfalls.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nProvide IREE to godot engine.\nUses the Vulkan back end.\n\ninput_count\ninput/0/data (TypedArray)\noutput_count\noutput/0/data (TypedArray)\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nHave a playground for testing.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDon’t use onnx because it doesn’t have vulkan support which limits reach.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a small number of gdscript lines.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nI know how, and no one else is doing it.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nSHARK\nIREE in-tree samples: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples\nIREE extra/more complex samples: https://github.com/iree-org/iree-samples\nIREE dynamic shapes sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/dynamic_shapes\nIREE CPU/Vulkan/CUDA sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/simple_embedding\nXLA axpy example: https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/examples/axpy\nnod.ai SHARK: https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK\nnod.ai SHARK results on AMD GPUs using Vulkan: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/"

The current implementation mimics mouse input, but it fails to translate global positions correctly. Review the global_to_viewport function and ensure it returns the correct value for local_at.\n\n\n\nFixing the menus will enable players to interact with them using VR controllers, enhancing the user experience.\n\n\n\nFixing the menus may require significant code changes, introducing potential bugs or conflicts that need proper testing to ensure stability.\n\n\n\nExploring alternative input systems specifically designed for VR controllers could be considered, but it may involve rewriting a large portion of the menu code and potentially introducing new dependencies.\n\n\n\nThis fix targets players using VR controllers to interact with the menus.

    "text": "Proposed: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: superseded by 20230602-limited-tracker-placement.md \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\nRight Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\nLeft Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\nRight Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

It’s an inductive method that learns to generate embeddings by leveraging node feature information and the graph structure.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the GraphSAGE algorithm can be challenging due to its complex nature and the use of various mathematical concepts. This proposal aims to break down the algorithm into understandable components and explain how it works in a clear and concise manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm incrementally aggregates and updates the representations of each node by considering the information from its local neighbors at each depth.\nAs the depth K increases, nodes incorporate information from a wider neighborhood.\nThe choice of aggregator functions can vary and has a significant impact on the performance and the type of information aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph G(V,E)G(V,E): The input graph with nodes VV and edges EE.\nInput Features {xv∀v∈V}{xv​∀v∈V}: The features for each node in the graph.\nDepth KK: The depth of the search or the number of iterations.\nWeight Matrices Wk∀k∈{1…K}Wk​∀k∈{1…K}: The weight matrices used for each depth kk.\nNon-linearity σσ: A non-linear activation function.\nAggregator Functions AGGREGATEk∀k∈{1…K}AGGREGATEk​∀k∈{1…K}: Functions that aggregate information from the node’s neighbors.\nNeighborhood Function NN: A function that returns the set of neighbors for a given node.\n\n\n\n\n\nVector Representations zv∀v∈Vzv​∀v∈V: The resulting vector representations for all nodes in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialization: Each node’s feature vector xvxv​ is used as the initial representation hv0hv0​.\nIteration for Depth KK: For each depth level from 1 to KK:\n\nFor each node vv in the graph:\n\nAggregate the representations of the nodes in its neighborhood N(v)N(v) using the aggregator function AGGREGATEkAGGREGATEk​ for that depth.

It allows for inductive learning, which means it can handle unseen nodes without requiring retraining. This makes it particularly useful for dynamic graphs where nodes may be added or removed over time.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm’s performance heavily depends on the choice of aggregator functions and the quality of node features. Poorly chosen functions or low-quality features can lead to suboptimal embeddings. Additionally, the algorithm may not perform well on graphs with complex structures or those that lack sufficient node feature information.\n\n\n\nAlternative methods for generating node embeddings, such as transductive learning algorithms, could be considered. However, these methods typically require retraining when new nodes are added, making them less suitable for dynamic graphs.\n\n\n\nWhile GraphSAGE is highly effective for many graph-based machine learning tasks, it may not be the best choice for all scenarios. For instance, in cases where the graph structure is less important than node features, other methods like feature-based machine learning models might be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nYes, this explanation of the GraphSAGE algorithm has been developed by us, with assistance from AI assistant Aria.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs"

Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Proposed: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nVR Tracker USB dongles need line of sight.\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement. Placed behind the body.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.\nRight Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

We may try prototyping this type of system in multiple ways.\n\n\n\nThis keeps low latency but reduces the needed bandwidth to sync 100,000 entites.\nNapkin math:\n50 bytes per frame per object * 100,000 objects = 5MB per frame.\n5MB/frame * 20 fps = 100MB = 1Gbps\nIf we send updates of all obejcts to all objects, that requires 100Tb/s\n\n&gt; yea 100k users at once is impossible any way you put it.

I think a realistic goal is 1k, as like, our max goal\n\nRight, so you would need to not send updates for far away objects\n\nOnly send 1000 closest objects: 1Tb/s\n\n+ Send faraway objects at 2Hz: 100Gb/s\n\n+ Heavy delta compression: 10Gb/s\n\nThis is for all players\n\nThie means, in a hypothetical universe where distant objects only need position sync, a server with 10Gb/s NIC could theoretically run 100,000 concurrent users, if optimizzed!\n\nAlso, therefore, per player bandwidth **of distant objects** would be 100Kbit/s of downstream data, which is pretty small.\n\nAgain I haven't accounted for IK synchronization, or for additional nearby objects, so it could be higher here.\nNearby objects is a smaller problem and easier to solve, and belongs in a separate proposal."

As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAYON is an open-source pipeline platform designed for creative studios, particularly those involved in animation and visual effects (VFX). It provides a robust and scalable solution for managing and executing creative projects. AYON’s source code is publicly accessible, allowing for community-driven development and customization. It is geared towards creative studios, particularly those working in animation and VFX. Evolved from OpenPype, it has been used since 2018 in various production environments. Supported and funded by the creative industry, AYON also offers comprehensive documentation for users, including guides for administrators and developers.\n\n\n\nHosted cloud services provide a flexible and scalable infrastructure solution that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an organization. They offer a range of services including compute power, storage, and networking capabilities, as well as advanced services such as machine learning and data analytics. These services are typically provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, making them a cost-effective option for many organizations.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate AYON on hosted cloud services for a game development studio.\n\n\n\nDeploy AYON using a single Docker image with hosted cloud services for Redis and PostgreSQL.\n\n\nRun a release of https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/releases on Windows 11 desktop.\n\n\n\nWhy does OpenPype use mongodb?\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will configure AYON according to the needs of a typical game development studio. This includes setting up workflows for creating assets and assemblages in Blender, and importing them into the Godot Engine.\n\nSet the fps to 30.\nSet the resolution to 3840 × 2160\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we will integrate Google Drive with the AYON homesite. This will allow us to store all our files and data directly into Google Drive from the AYON homesite.\n\n\n\nWe will then run a series of tests to assess the performance, reliability, and usability of AYON on hosted cloud services. These tests will simulate tasks a 3D game studio would typically perform, such as creating and modifying assets in Blender, and importing these assets into the Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nFinally, we will document our findings from the tests and provide recommendations based on the evaluation results. This will help us understand how well AYON performs on hosted cloud services, and whether it is a suitable solution for game development studios using the Godot Engine.\n\n\n\n\nImplementing AYON on hosted cloud services could potentially streamline the workflow of game development studios, making project management more efficient and effective.\n\n\n\nThere may be compatibility issues between AYON and hosted cloud services that could affect performance or functionality. Additionally, there may be a learning curve for teams unfamiliar with AYON.\n\n\n\nAlternative solutions such as proprietary pipeline platforms were considered. However, the open-source nature of AYON provides more flexibility and customization options.\n\n\n\nIn cases where the studio is working on multiple platforms or using a variety of software, additional configuration and testing may be required to ensure AYON works seamlessly across all environments.\n\n\n\nThis evaluation aligns with our core competencies in evaluating and implementing technology solutions. As such, it should be executed by our team.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nAYON Docker\nayon-2023-8-production-beta\n\nThis article was assisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "text": "Deploy AYON using a single Docker image with hosted cloud services for Redis and PostgreSQL.\n\n\nRun a release of https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/releases on Windows 11 desktop.\n\n\n\nWhy does OpenPype use mongodb?\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will configure AYON according to the needs of a typical game development studio. This includes setting up workflows for creating assets and assemblages in Blender, and importing them into the Godot Engine.\n\nSet the fps to 30.\nSet the resolution to 3840 × 2160\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we will integrate Google Drive with the AYON homesite. This will allow us to store all our files and data directly into Google Drive from the AYON homesite.\n\n\n\nWe will then run a series of tests to assess the performance, reliability, and usability of AYON on hosted cloud services. These tests will simulate tasks a 3D game studio would typically perform, such as creating and modifying assets in Blender, and importing these assets into the Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nFinally, we will document our findings from the tests and provide recommendations based on the evaluation results. This will help us understand how well AYON performs on hosted cloud services, and whether it is a suitable solution for game development studios using the Godot Engine."

Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users’ input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; D(Combine Variations)\n  B --&gt; E(Base Model)\n  C --&gt; F(Shape Variation)\n  C --&gt; G(Color Variation)\n  C --&gt; H(Texture Variation)\n  F --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  G --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  H --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  E --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  I --&gt; J(Final Output)\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\nUser Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\nSelect Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\nApply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\nCombine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\nGenerate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user’s preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform’s appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEnhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\nUser personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\nEfficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nComplexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\nPerformance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDo nothing.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

You will need Elixir installed.\nI recommend getting the latest, but for these steps, I am using Elixir v1.13.3.\nDownload Uro from https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nWe are using the dev environment. It is the default, but you can also set MIX_ENV=dev.\nTo compile HTML/CSS webpack:\ncd assets\nnpm install\nnpm run deploy\ncd ..\nIf the compile gives issues, you can run it multiple times. To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\nmix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It will integrate the desync protocol and include error handling strategies for failed updates or data synchronization issues.\nThe GUI Launcher will be designed using the Godot Engine and will also integrate the desync protocol. It will feature a basic visual setup with V-Sekai branding.\nThe Game Sample will involve developing a basic visual sample with V-Sekai branding, planning for testing each component to ensure functionality, addressing security concerns including user data protection and secure updates, and discussing scalability potential with increasing users or larger game updates.\nEach table will have its own schema module representing different aspects of the application such as modes, versions, and update processes.\n\n\n\nThis system promotes seamless gaming with high performance and reliability from Elixir and CockroachDB.\n\n\n\nTechnology integration may lead to complex issues and compatibility challenges.\n\n\n\nExternal updaters and manual patches were dismissed for their demanding nature.\n\n\n\nDesign will allow manual update initiation for situations like limited bandwidth.\n\n\n\nThe V-Sekai team will develop and maintain this launcher backend.

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently has limitations when it comes to creating avatars with specific features and customizations. This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n\n\nSource: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json if the avatar is in GLTF format, or image/png or image/svg+xml if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.\nFilter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.\nSink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be image/png or image/svg+xml for 2D avatars, and application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json for 3D avatars.\n\nNote: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats. PNG and SVG are lossless image formats, while GLTF is a lossless 3D format that preserves the fidelity of the avatar model.\n\n\n\nHere are the converted inputs and outputs in the xstate format for each step:\n\nImporting the avatar into Godot Engine and “Project Mirage”:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nRefining the imported avatar:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nConverting spring bone to physical simulation bones and colliders:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: assetpackage file\n\nAddressing painting errors:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nChoosing a material:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nResolving issues with materials and bones:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCorrecting colors and addressing pleated folds:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCreating complex geometric structures:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nUtilizing Vroid Hub’s hair painter and mesh generator:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm enhanced data\n\n\nAdding facial expressions for motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .gltf motion capture data\n\n\nSetting up motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: vrm animations data stored as .gltf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\nThe avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\nDetailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\nMotion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\nSome steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\nPainting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai’s avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars. By implementing these tools and techniques within the platform, V-Sekai can offer a more robust and user-friendly experience for its community.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nCompile IREE as a C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine 4.0.\nUse the Vulkan backend to run the image superresolution demo.\nLoad and process ML models for image superresolution using IREE.\nIntegrate the resulting functionality into V-Sekai’s existing image processing pipeline.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nAllow image superresolution in V-Sekai.\nEnhanced performance due to IREE’s efficient MLIR-based compiler and runtime.\nScalable solution that adapts to various hardware and software constraints. Not only NVIDIA, but ARM, Intel, AMD and Apple gpus.\nAllow using other machine learning models from PyTorch and Tensorflow\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nAdditional development time required for integration and optimization.\nPotential trade-offs in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse a custom script to work around the image superresolution issue.\n\nThis might not provide a scalable or high-performance solution.\n\nImplement a different image superresolution algorithm.\n\nThis could lead to suboptimal results compared to IREE’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nA custom script could serve as a workaround for infrequent use of image superresolution, but it may have drawbacks in terms of efficiency, output quality, and maintenance efforts. If the feature aligns with V-Sekai’s goals and significantly improves user experience, integrating the IREE-based solution into the core might be more effective.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIn summary, integrating the IREE-based image superresolution feature into V-Sekai’s core offers several benefits, including an enhanced user experience, performance optimization, alignment with open source values, and easier maintenance and support. These advantages contribute to a better, more immersive VR experience while staying true to V-Sekai’s project goals.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nIREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment): https://github.com/openxla/iree\nGodot Engine: https://godotengine.org\nVulkan Backend: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/\nIREE.gd: https://github.com/RechieKho/IREE.gd"

In that case, it feels like WebRTC may jump past firewalls easier, and there’s existing turn-ice stuff.\nMy colleague noted that you could have one Godot engine server provide a proxy to another Godot server. The design was similar to cell phone vs cell phone tower vs tower to tower distribution of messages. It wasn’t clear that was possible, but he found something. Any thoughts about that?\n\n\nProblems\nWebRTC is much more complex to set up, so I don’t think it is a good alternative for ENet for indies.\nWebRTC needs infrastructure; ENet does not.\nDependency problems between ScriptInstance and PacketPeer. What do you mean?\nThe script_language.h includes packet_peer.h, so PacketPeer cannot use GDVIRTUAL because that needs script_language.h\n\nQuestions\nHow do modern games different games have different bandwidth minimums?\nCents per hour to host how many players?\nHole-punching for pure peer-to-peer games.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is compiled into the project and is work to change.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nNetworking is part of the project and can’t be changed by mods.\n\n\nReferences\nNo response\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

However, there is still room for improvement in the import process and support for additional file formats. The current Blender importer for Godot Engine 4.0 requires an additional installation and injects a Python script into Blender.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop an addon that can simultaneously export colliders, occluders, and LOD variants for a given mesh without requiring an additional Blender importer.\nEnhance the existing import process by providing better error handling, reporting, and automatic fixes for common issues.\nImprove the performance of the import process, especially for large and complex 3D models.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an addon that automatically searches for and sets Geometry Nodes input constants with relevant names (e.g., is_occluder, is_collider, and LOD) while exporting, giving modelers maximum flexibility on how different versions of a mesh should be exported. This addon should not require an additional Blender importer or Python script injection.\nUpdate the import pipeline to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback to users.\nOptimize the import process by implementing caching, parallel processing, and other performance improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers will have more control over the export process, allowing them to easily manage colliders, occluders, and LOD variants without needing an additional Blender importer.\nThe improved import process will reduce the time spent on fixing import-related issues.\nFaster import times will lead to a smoother development experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping an addon may require additional resources and maintenance.\nThere might be potential licensing issues with integrating third-party libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelying solely on community plugins for additional import functionality.\nLimiting support to only a few popular file formats.\n\n\n\n\nNo, this enhancement addresses a core limitation in the engine and requires significant changes to the import pipeline.\n\n\n\nYes, improving the 3D import functionality is essential for providing a better user experience and supporting a wider range of 3D modeling tools. It also ensures that V-Sekai remains competitive with other game engines.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

The chief engineer’s prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.\nThe second mechanism is cross-functional communication.

    "title": "Accepted: Adding Entity Networking to Groups",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,Lyuma,SaracenOne\n\n\n\nFor Groups, this system aims to solve the following issues:\n\n(A) Need a way to standardize scene spawning.\n(B) Need a way to refer to nodes/instances that is consistent across clients (for example, “Set parent to …”).\n(C) Need a way to synchronize state between clients.\n(D) Provides a basic set of standard protocols and interactions.\n(E) Provides the basis for a security/privacy model regarding entity communication/permissions over the network.\n(F) Provides a security model locally for access between nodes of one entity and nodes of another entity (assuming a secure scripting framework is implemented).\n(G) This also solves the problem of abstracting away implementation details of entities; for example, there should be no need to deal with Godot nodes on an individual basis.\n(H) Provide a unified way to create top-level physics hierarchies isolated from other game logic.\n\nNote: This proposal covers three Spawn Types:\n\nSpawn type (i) Entities integrated into a map;\nSpawn type (ii) map entities spawned by clients; and\nSpawn type (iii) avatar entities/props spawned by clients.)\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed.

    "text": "As indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network."

    "text": "Todo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,networking,\n\n\n\n\nOur project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.\nSomeone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I’m still thinking about that experience.\n\n\n\nWe propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nBy monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.\nWe believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeserver: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.\nSimulation server: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has authority over, including player simulation servers.\nKhepri: A tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and Elixir, used for maintaining a nested path-to-value store.\nRaft cluster: A cluster of servers implementing the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency and fault tolerance.\nOwnership: The player who has control over a game entity and can change its state.\nMastership: The authority that can change ownership rules and default ownership settings.\nAsk, Deny, Allow: Rules set by the Master for ownership transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach type of server can only be Khepri members of the same type.\nEach server can only allow be Khepri members of the same logical instance.\nRaft is only active inside of each logical instance.\nHomeserver servers are REST + JSON and the cheap pattern.\nSimulation servers are using the nasty state transfer pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nAction\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to the home server to fetch the public key of Player B.\n\n\n2\nThe home server retrieves Player B’s public key from its database and sends it back to Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n3\nPlayer A’s simulation server uses Player B’s public key to encrypt a message or binary data.\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s simulation server signs the encrypted message or binary data using its own private key.\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends the encrypted message or binary data along with the digital signature to Player B’s simulation server using the membrane_udp_plugin.\n\n\n6\nPlayer B’s simulation server receives the message and verifies the digital signature using Player A’s public key, which it retrieves from the home server.\n\n\n7\nIf the signature is valid, Player B’s simulation server uses its own private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original data sent by Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n8\nIf the message is confidential, Player B’s simulation server may want to send a response back to Player A’s simulation server using a similar protocol, with Player A’s public key retrieved from the home server.\n\n\n\nThis table outlines the steps of the communication protocol between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers, which involves retrieving public keys from the home server’s database, encrypting and signing messages, and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the messages. This protocol ensures secure and confidential communication between the two simulation servers, allowing for safe and reliable data exchange.\n# EC examples\nalice_private_jwk = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-alice.pem\")\nalice_public_jwk  = JOSE.JWK.to_public(alice_private_jwk)\nbob_private_jwk   = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-bob.pem\")\nbob_public_jwk    = JOSE.JWK.to_public(bob_private_jwk)\n\n## Encrypt and Decrypt (defaults to ECDH-ES with A128GCM)\n### Alice sends Bob a secret message using Bob's public key and Alice's private key\nalice_to_bob = \"For Bob's eyes only.\"\nencrypted = JOSE.JWK.box_encrypt(alice_to_bob, bob_public_jwk, alice_private_jwk)\n### Only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key (Alice's public key is embedded in the JWE header)\n{^alice_to_bob, _} = JOSE.JWK.box_decrypt(encrypted, bob_private_jwk)\n\n\n\nIn a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nMonitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority request to Player B’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s homeserver sends a response to Player A’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority response to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nSending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B’s homeserver without waiting for confirmation.\nTotal hops: 3 + 2 * H\nCase 2: Authority transfer if Player A’s and Player B’s homeservers are exactly the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends a response directly to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nTotal hops: 3\nIn this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation. By removing this step, we reduce the total hop count by 1, potentially improving the efficiency of the authority transfer process when both players are on the same home server.\nCase 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers on the same home server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an update directly to Player B’s simulation server using a hand-optimized binary layout and an asynchronous communication model.\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server using credit-based flow control or another asynchronous technique.\n1\n\n\n\nIn this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system’s features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.\n\n\n\nStrong consistency guarantees\nAccess control over Khepri instances\nScalability\nMinimized network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity: The proposed system involves multiple components, such as homeservers, simulation servers, Khepri instances, and Raft clusters. Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.\nPerformance: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\nScalability: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system’s functionality.\nLoad balancing: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.\n\n\n\nThis is not a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nI am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server model.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nKhepri documentation: https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri\nRaft consensus algorithm: https://raft.github.io/\nNetworked Physics in Virtual Reality: https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/\nChapter 7 - Advanced Architecture using ZeroMQ: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter7/"

Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system’s functionality.\nLoad balancing: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.\n\n\n\nThis is not a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nI am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server model.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nKhepri documentation: https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri\nRaft consensus algorithm: https://raft.github.io/\nNetworked Physics in Virtual Reality: https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/\nChapter 7 - Advanced Architecture using ZeroMQ: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter7/"

The platform can only support a limited amount of content.\n\n\n\nThe challenge lies in optimizing the content to fit within the platform’s limitations without compromising on the quality and detail.\n\n\n\nUse OpenSubdiv to increase detail, which can then be reduced through Godot Engine’s LOD (Level of Detail) scheme. This allows for high-quality models that are optimized for performance.\n\n\n\nThe upside is that this approach allows for more detailed models while still maintaining good performance.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that it requires additional processing to create the LOD models, which could potentially slow down the development process.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to manually create lower detail models for use in less demanding scenarios. However, this would require significantly more work from the creators.\n\n\n\nThis strategy might not be beneficial for very simple models or scenes where the level of detail is not a significant factor.\n\n\n\nYes, this strategy is implemented in the core of our platform and maintained by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\n\nThis article is assisted by AI."

    "text": "Draft: VMD on VRM AnimationTree Node\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nEirexe made a VMD player based on Lox’s work.\nThis new ability means we now have a viable way to load VMD motions and use them as a VRM motion player.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe want to make an AnimationTree node to drive Miku Miku VMD motion and add other procedural animation features to blend motion on the VRM Avatar.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nHowever, we need to make some changes to the AnimationTree UI editor to make the changes possible. We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nEasy Charts"

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is embarking on a project that translates speech into corresponding facial shapes for virtual reality applications. This process eliminates the need for a face camera and leverages the SpeechEncoderDecoderModel from Hugging Face’s Transformers library for comprehensive speech recognition.\nThe SpeakingFaces dataset, a collection from 142 diverse subjects, will be utilized for this project. The dataset is accessible via the server of the Institute for Smart Systems and Artificial Intelligence (ISSAI) under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nOutlines 〰, a neural text generation library, will also play a crucial role in this project. It offers robust prompting primitives, separates the prompting from the execution logic, and is compatible with all models. It interfaces with models through the next-token logits and can be used with API-based models as well.\n\n\n\nThe primary challenge lies in developing a model capable of generating text and blendshapes simultaneously from the same input speech using the Outlines 〰 library.\n\n\n\nThe proposed strategy involves creating a custom model that accepts speech as input and outputs both text and blendshapes. This unified model would incorporate a shared encoder to process the speech input, and a single decoder to generate the text and blendshape outputs. The Outlines 〰 library will be used to conform the output to the desired format.\nfrom outlines import Outline\nfrom transformers import SpeechEncoderDecoderModel, Speech2Text2Processor, Wav2Vec2Model\nimport json\n\n# Initialize the processor and encoder\nprocessor = Speech2Text2Processor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/s2t-small-librispeech-asr\")\nencoder = Wav2Vec2Model.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\n\n# Initialize the decoder\ndecoder = Speech2Text2Model.from_pretrained(\"facebook/s2t-small-librispeech-asr\")\n\n# Initialize the unified model\nmodel = UnifiedSpeechEncoderDecoderModel(encoder=encoder, decoder=decoder)\n\n# Define an outline for the model\noutline = Outline(model).to(device)\n\n# Generate text and blendshapes\ngenerated_text, generated_blendshapes = outline.generate(input_speech)\n\n# Conform to JSON schemaßß\nblendshapes_keys = [\"BrowInnerUp\", \"BrowDownLeft\", \"BrowDownRight\", \"BrowOuterUpLeft\", \"BrowOuterUpRight\",\n                    \"EyeLookUpLeft\", \"EyeLookUpRight\", \"EyeLookDownLeft\", \"EyeLookDownRight\", \"EyeLookInLeft\",\n                    \"EyeLookInRight\", \"EyeLookOutLeft\", \"EyeLookOutRight\", \"EyeBlinkLeft\", \"EyeBlinkRight\",\n                    \"EyeSquintRight\", \"EyeSquintLeft\", \"EyeWideLeft\", \"EyeWideRight\", \"CheekPuff\",\n                    \"CheekSquintLeft\", \"CheekSquintRight\", \"NoseSneerLeft\", \"NoseSneerRight\", \"JawOpen\",\n                    \"JawForward\", \"JawLeft\", \"JawRight\", \"MouthFunnel\", \"MouthPucker\", \"MouthLeft\",\n                    \"MouthRight\", \"MouthRollUpper\", \"MouthRollLower\", \"MouthShrugUpper\", \"MouthShrugLower\",\n                    \"MouthClose\", \"MouthSmileLeft\", \"MouthSmileRight\", \"MouthFrownLeft\", \"MouthFrownRight\",\n                    \"MouthDimpleLeft\", \"MouthDimpleRight\", \"MouthUpperUpLeft\", \"MouthUpperUpRight\",\n                    \"MouthLowerDownLeft\", \"MouthLowerDownRight\", \"MouthPressLeft\", \"MouthPressRight\",\n                    \"MouthStretchLeft\", \"MouthStretchRight\", \"TongueOut\"]\n\noutput = {\n    \"text\": generated_text,\n    \"blendshapes\": dict(zip(blendshapes_keys, generated_blendshapes))\n}\n\njson_output = json.dumps(output)\n\n\n\nDeveloping our own unified model for generating both text and blendshapes from speech using the Outlines 〰 library is a strategic move that provides us with greater control and customization to meet our specific needs. It not only deepens our understanding of the model, aiding in troubleshooting and improvements, but also allows us to optimize it for better performance and efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe limitation of this approach is that the UnifiedSpeechEncoderDecoderModel, and Outline are placeholders for your actual unified model classes, and outline respectively. You would need to implement these classes yourself, or find pre-trained models that suit your needs.\n\n\n\nBeing self-reliant in maintaining and updating our model eliminates dependence on third parties, providing flexibility to make changes as needed. Moreover, it ensures seamless integration with other parts of our system.\n\n\n\nWhile this approach requires more initial effort, the potential for improvement and fine-tuning with our unique data sets makes it worthwhile, leading to superior results in the long run.\n\n\n\nYes, the development and maintenance of the unified model will be done by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Webrtc chat test\nThe conversation between “iFire” and “Bioblaze Payne” focuses on testing WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) in a gaming context, specifically in relation to Unreal Engine. iFire queries about creating a chat message scenario that could simulate the stress of 280 peers, to which Bioblaze suggests using a JSON object with random names and messages replicated across all clients. They discuss generating these messages at random intervals to stress test the system.\nBioblaze recommends including a random vector 3 and vector 4 in the messages, though they are unsure of the exact length needed. The discussion then shifts to the simulation of a “rigid body chair” and a character with 200 bones, with iFire contemplating the number of bones in a chair. Bioblaze advises sending packages containing all player bones, randomized repeatedly, to test the system’s load capacity.\nThey also propose monitoring the time response between client communications, breaking it down into specific millisecond intervals (16ms, 32ms, 64ms, 128ms) for replication sync. The idea is to measure the lag in responses. iFire mentions a UTC timestamp function they created in Godot, which leads to Bioblaze suggesting that each client should record the time and details of received messages for later analysis. This data would then be compiled into a database, with SQL queries used to determine average response times and lag compensation. The conversation concludes with iFire deciding to document the discussion for future reference."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article is a detailed account of the journey to develop a networked physics sample for Virtual Reality (VR), sponsored by Oculus. The source code developed was published under a permissive open source license, BSD. In this edition, we have added the ability for avatars to interact with the chairs, including sitting on them.\n\n\nThe initial idea was to create a table where four players could interact with physically simulated chairs instead of cubes. After experimenting with Unity and C#, it was found that scaling up the chairs to around a meter cubed made the VR experience more interesting. We also wanted to ensure that the avatars could sit on these chairs, adding another layer of interaction.\n\n\n\nThe success criteria were defined as follows:\n\nPlayers should be able to pick up, throw and catch chairs without latency.\nPlayers should be able to stack chairs, and these stacks should be stable and without visible jitter.\nWhen chairs thrown by any player interact with the simulation, these interactions should be without latency.\nAvatars should be able to sit on the chairs.\n\n\n\n\nTo allow avatars to sit on the chairs, we implemented a new interaction model. When an avatar approaches a chair, they can choose to “sit” on it. This triggers an animation of the avatar sitting, and the avatar’s position is adjusted to match the chair’s position. The avatar remains seated until they choose to “stand up”, at which point they return to their normal standing position.\n\n\n\nHigh quality networked physics with stable stacks of chairs is possible with Unity and PhysX using a distributed simulation network model. This approach is best used for cooperative experiences only, as it does not provide the security of a server-authoritative network model with dedicated servers and client-side prediction. With the addition of avatar-chair interaction, we have added another layer of immersion to the VR experience.\nThe source code for the networked physics sample can be downloaded here.\nNote: This article is based on the work of Glenn Fiedler but has been adapted by V-Sekai to use chairs instead of cubes and to allow avatars to sit on the chairs."

    "text": "This article is a detailed account of the author’s journey to develop a networked physics sample for Virtual Reality (VR), sponsored by Oculus. The source code developed was published under a permissive open source license, BSD.\n\n\nThe initial idea was to create a table where four players could interact with physically simulated cubes. However, after experimenting with Unity and C#, the author found that scaling up the cubes to around a meter cubed made the VR experience more interesting.\n\n\n\nThe success criteria were defined as follows:\n\nPlayers should be able to pick up, throw and catch cubes without latency.\nPlayers should be able to stack cubes, and these stacks should be stable and without visible jitter.\nWhen cubes thrown by any player interact with the simulation, these interactions should be without latency.\n\n\n\n\nThree main network models were considered:\n\nDeterministic lockstep\nClient/server with client-side prediction\nDistributed simulation with authority scheme\n\nThe author chose a distributed simulation model where players take over authority of cubes they interact with. This decision was based on the non-deterministic nature of the Unity physics engine (PhysX) and the need to hide latency.\n\n\n\nEach cube would have an authority, set to default or to the player that last interacted with it. If another player interacted with an object, authority would switch to that player. Ownership was different - once a cube is owned by a player, no other player could take ownership until that player relinquished ownership.\n\n\n\nThe author proved that state synchronization works with Unity and PhysX by setting up a loopback scene in Unity where cubes fall into a pile in front of the player. The state of each cube was captured and applied to the right side (non-authority) 10 times per-second, keeping the left and right simulations in sync.\n\n\n\nSeveral techniques were used to optimize bandwidth:\n\nEncoding the state for at rest cubes more efficiently.\nUsing lossy techniques such as reducing the precision of the physics state sent over the network.\nQuantizing the state on both sides.\nSending only a subset of cubes in each packet.\nImplementing delta compression.\n\n\n\n\nThe author implemented interaction with the simulation via touch controllers. The position and orientation of the avatar components were captured along with the rest of the physics state, and applied to the avatar components in the remote view.\n\n\n\nThe host player acts as the arbiter, deciding which updates to accept and which to ignore. Two sequence numbers per-cube (authority sequence and ownership sequence) were used to determine if an update should be accepted.\n\n\n\nHigh quality networked physics with stable stacks of cubes is possible with Unity and PhysX using a distributed simulation network model. This approach is best used for cooperative experiences only, as it does not provide the security of a server-authoritative network model with dedicated servers and client-side prediction.\nThe source code for the networked physics sample can be downloaded here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The strategy we want to use is called variable bit rate encoding to optimize bandwidth use.\nIn the context of our game, this strategy can be applied to reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network for each snapshot. Here’s how it could work with our TimeOffsetPacket and DataPacket structures:\n\nKeyframe Omission: Instead of sending a full update (a keyframe) for every frame, you only send keyframes at specific intervals. In between these keyframes, you send more minor updates (delta frames) that describe how the game state has changed since the last keyframe. This is where the frame_within_metablock and frame_offset fields come into play. They allow you to specify which keyframe a particular delta frame is relative to.\nInterpolation: On the receiving end, the game client uses the data from the keyframes and delta frames to interpolate the game state for the frames in between. This means that even though you send less data, the client can still produce a smooth animation. The x_offset, y_offset, and z_offset fields in the DataPacket structure are used for this purpose. They provide the information needed to calculate the position of an entity at any given frame.\nVariable Bit Rate Encoding: The time_bit_width, x_bit_width, y_bit_width, and z_bit_width fields in the TimeOffsetPacket structure allow you to use different amounts of bits for different types of data. For example, if an entity’s x, y, and z positions don’t change much from one frame to the next, you might use fewer bits to represent these values. This can help to reduce the size of your snapshots further.\nOctahedral Compression: The rotation of the rigid bodies is stored as an octahedral normal, which is a very efficient way to represent 3D rotations. This can significantly reduce the data needed to represent the orientation of each rigid body.\n\n\n\nGiven the Entity struct:\nstruct TimeOffsetPacket {\n    uint16_t frame_within_metablock; // Bits 0-15\n    uint8_t time_bit_width;          // Bits 16-19\n    uint8_t x_bit_width;             // Bits 20-23\n    uint8_t y_bit_width;             // Bits 24-27\n    uint8_t z_bit_width;             // Bits 28-31\n    uint32_t byte_offset_to_first_packet; // Bits 0-23 of high word\n    uint8_t amount_of_packets_that_follow; // Bits 24-31 of high word\n};\n\nstruct DataPacket {\n    uint16_t base_x_value; // bits 0-15\n    uint16_t base_y_value; // bits 16-31\n    uint16_t base_z_value; // bits 32-47\n    // The following fields are bit-compressed\n    uint16_t frame_offset; // [Time bit width] (unsigned)\n    int16_t x_offset;      // [X bit width] (signed)\n    int16_t y_offset;      // [Y bit width] (signed)\n    int16_t z_offset;      // [Z bit width] (signed)\n};\n// Given values\nint size_of_time_offset_packet = 11;\nint size_of_data_packet = 14;\nint total_bytes = 1596;\nint packets_per_entity = 4;\nint packets_per_bone = 2;\n\n// Calculate the number of DataPackets we can store after accounting for one TimeOffsetPacket\nint data_packet_count = (total_bytes - size_of_time_offset_packet) / size_of_data_packet; // This will be 113\n\n// Calculate the number of DataPackets we can store after accounting for the entity's position, orientation, linear_velocity and angular_velocity\ndata_packet_count = data_packet_count - packets_per_entity; // This will be 109\n\n// Now, let's solve for the number of bones\nint total_bones = data_packet_count / packets_per_bone; // This will be 54\n\nTimeOffsetPacket\nA complete RigidBody structure on the server consists of position, orientation, linear_velocity, and angular_velocity.\nRotation is stored as x/y is an octahedral normal storing axis, while z is the rotation.

Key highlights include updates to the godot-vrm repository, security improvements in the v-sekai-game repository, and progress on animation retargeting and PMX character structure. Additionally, a fix was implemented for Skeleton3D’s rest_dirty reset issue.\n\nFork created: aaronfranke/godot-vrm (01/06/2023)\nNew commits in V-Sekai/godot-vrm repository, including updates to load_at_runtime_scene for 4.x and adding files_dropped functionality (02/06/2023)\nPR 130 closed, bumping github/codeql-action from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nPR 129 closed, bumping actions/setup-dotnet from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nStepSecurity bot opened PR 131 to apply security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to avoid the empty avatar crash (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error (02/06/2023)\nNew tag created in V-Sekai/godot: groups-4.x.2023-06-03T034215Z (02/06/2023)\nPR 131 closed, applying security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to make joining a server less crashy (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to remove debug points (02/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: codeql (02/06/2023)\nPR 132 opened, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew comment on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing how to make a VRM model pose using GDScript (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error part 3, avoiding runtime errors, and removing gut (02/06/2023 - 03/06/2023)\nPR 132 closed, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nPR 133 opened, hardening GitHub Actions in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nNew comments on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing animation retargeting and PMX character structure (03/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including removing hardcoded gravity and gravity direction, inverting state machine condition, and setting up work in progress state chart (03/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: state-chart (03/06/2023)\nSkeleton3D now correctly resets rest_dirty only after all bone transforms have been updated (PR 78025 by lyuma). This also resolves the SkeletonGizmo display issue when there is more than one bone root.\n\n\n\nThe team has introduced a feature that allows for easy setup with just a single click. Additionally, they’re now utilizing an advanced system known as the Many Bones’ solver.\n\n\n\nThere were some concerns about how much time the GPU was spending on processing the shader - think of the shader like a set of instructions telling the GPU how to draw each pixel. The frame times, or the speed at which frames are processed, seemed to be slower than expected. However, it was clarified that these tests were being run in a mode designed for finding errors (debug mode), not for optimal performance.\n\n\n\nThe team discussed how their system’s performance stacks up against other virtual reality social platforms. They used different types of hardware for these comparisons, similar to comparing the performance of different cars using various types of roads and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe team also talked about how to best optimize their system for different devices. This is akin to tuning a car’s engine differently depending on whether it’s going to be driven in the city or on a racetrack.\n\n\n\nThere were discussions about the challenges of rendering avatars, especially when there are multiple avatars on the screen at once. It’s like trying to paint multiple portraits at the same time - the more you have, the harder it gets. The team discussed the need for guidelines to help avatar creators optimize their designs for less powerful hardware.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to conduct more tests, particularly focusing on how well their system handles complex 3D models on Android devices. They also aim to create a benchmark scenario where they expect good performance across most platforms, much like setting a standard track to test different cars’ performances."

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints?
