### Proposal Title

Standard backup procedures for V-Sekai Github Organization.

### Context and Problem Statement

Things that aren't backed up get lost.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Backup V-Sekai Github organization with V-Sekai-gitm and V-Sekai-github-backup.


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Use https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai-gitim.git to backup V-sekai.

```
git clone https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai-gitim.git
cd V-Sekai-gitim
pip install .
cd -
export ACCESS_TOKEN=AAAA
python3 -m gitim -o V-Sekai -d V-Sekai-godot-gitm-`date --iso=date --utc` --ssh --token $ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Use https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai-github-backup to backup.
 
```
pip install github-backup
export ACCESS_TOKEN=AAAA
github-backup V-Sekai --token $ACCESS_TOKEN --organization --output-directory V-Sekai-Backup-`date --iso=date --utc` --all --prefer-ssh --lfs -P -i
```

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not able to.

### Positive Consequences

- Two backups combined should cover all cases

### Negative Consequences

- github-backup doesn't backup repos that are accessible in the dependencies
- gitm doesn't backup issues

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Only we have access to a complete copy of the repo.
