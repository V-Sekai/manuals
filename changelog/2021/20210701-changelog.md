- 2021-07-26 00:22:31Z lyuma: I was able to resolve autoload cycles by passing references by loading them in the right order, and passing in the out-of-order (cyclic) references as constructor arguments, referencing them with a prefix instead of the autoload name

- 2021-07-19 19:23:28Z fire: "> iFire and I broke the ice, but feel this would be best served as a series of workshops together. We created this issue in the omigroup/gltf-extensions repo to track progress.
  <https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/issues/3>"

- 2021-07-13 12:18:26Z lyuma: Beware: autoload cycles are a problem: two files cannot reference each other without breaking the cycle in some way. Currently, I have about 7 references to EntityManager commented out from the network_manager addon, or else Godot hard crashes when loading the project.
- 2021-07-13 12:16:42Z lyuma:
  "Pushed <https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-hop-spin-dance> `groups_test_project` branch. The following addons now compile:

- 2021-07-10 20:31:09Z fire: For next week I'm going to get a build of groupx-4.x to cicd and then start iterating on "Two person floating name tags in a networked Groups 4.x with the ability to pass beachballs". I asked my friend gameplay programmer and we determined that waiting for all the things to port to Godot Engine 4 has a high latency. I'm trying a new approach of growing the code base feature by feature as it was done originally for 3.x.
