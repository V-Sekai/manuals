## The Backdrop

The conversation between iFire and cyberpunkmermaid reveals an innovative idea of creating a portable VR setup. iFire has a cart with a PCVR computer in it. This setup streams to a Quest 3, which is a virtual reality headset. The system uses portable light houses on clamped sticks for tracking.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in integrating the power of the Valve VR ecosystem with the portability of the Quest series. It requires careful selection and arrangement of components to create a mobile VR station that can stream your desktop to your Meta Quest 2 or 3.

## The Strategy

The strategy involves using 6 HTC or Tundra trackers motion capture. One tracker is dedicated to the continuous calibration with the Meta Quest 3 HMD and the SteamVR ecosystem. Two are used for the foot, two for the shoulders, one for the chest, one for the hips. The setup also includes 2 or 4 light houses and requires the purchase of Virtual Desktop for the Meta Quest 3.

## The Upside

The upside of this setup is its portability and versatility. It essentially turns your laptop into a mobile VR station, allowing you to leverage the power of the Valve VR ecosystem anywhere you go.

## The Downside

The downside could be the complexity of the setup and the cost of purchasing all the necessary components. However, the benefits of having a portable VR setup may outweigh these drawbacks for many users.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to use a standalone VR headset like the Oculus Quest 2, but this would not provide the same level of performance and compatibility with the Valve VR ecosystem.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In addition to regular use, the [V-Sekai-faceless](https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai-faceless) repository on GitHub provides a solution for interacting with the virtual world without needing to wear the HMD (Head-Mounted Display). This can be beneficial in various scenarios such as testing or when the HMD is uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This setup is not part of the core V-Sekai offering but is an innovative idea proposed by members of the community. It demonstrates the potential for creativity and innovation within the V-Sekai ecosystem.
