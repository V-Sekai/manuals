# Draft: To deploy backend services like Uro safely use a defined process

- Status: Draft <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a process for deploying Uro and other backend services safely

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Commit code to uro sandbox branch

    - GoCD job creates uro-sandbox docker image
    - docker image is auto deployed to sandbox

PR merges code to uro main branch

    - GoCD job creates uro docker image
    - docker image is auto deployed to staging (A/B)
    - manual interface to swap staging and live branch

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Not done yet.
Probably relies on a custom Elixir service in Kubernetes using Role-Based Access Control, so it can automatically change services:
