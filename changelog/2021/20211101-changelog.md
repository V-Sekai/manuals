### Changes

iFire: Builds of fbx2gltf from github cicd are now at <https://github.com/V-Sekai/FBX2glTF/releases>

iFire: Updated the godot branch. There was some some difficult with the blend-io branch so I merged it with other branch import something

MMMaellon: Didn't we use to have an IK channel? Anyway here's some of my ideas on how I plan to revamp RenIK. I'm still hoping that EWBIK takes over RENIK's IK solving one day, so I'm focusing on improving the walk cycle and leaving IK solving alone <https://mmmaellon.notion.site/Semi-Deterministic-Walk-Cycles-dbe1dcaa307e4fb9b85dd6ee920de20c>

iFire — 07/11/2021: Groups update to the latest Godot. 1. intersect rays api changed. 2. misc crash if precondition fails return
Oops forgot to upload a few branches.

iFire — 08/11/2021: <https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-blender> Now works on my Linux. Need some testing for Windows and Mac. Save a blend file into the godot project and it'll be openable as scene through tricks.
