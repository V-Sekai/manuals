# Proposed: Social RPG World Proposal

## Metadata

- Status: Proposed
- Deciders: V-Sekai
- Tags: V-Sekai

## Context and Problem Statement

We aim to engage users in the V-Sekai world. A social RPG game could be the solution, offering continuous gameplay that encourages interaction.

## Proposed Solution

### Setting

Our game is set in a "Comfortable Cyberprep" realm. It merges sci-fi with ease, where tech and humans coexist. Players explore a future city where technology is part of life. The city glows with neon lights, holographic interfaces, and advanced AI, yet retains homeliness.

1. Static couch collider: A fixed location for player interaction.
2. **Non-functional** Static bed without collider: A rejuvenation spot for characters.
3. **Non-functional** Mirror that is off: A decorative element with potential uses.
4. **Non-functional** Video player screen that is off: A feature for entertainment or information.

### Story

1. Chill and hang with friends: The game provides a relaxed environment for socializing.
2. Play a game: Beyond socializing, players can engage in an RPG game.

### Systems

1. RPG game with level rewards: Players improve through play.
2. Combat System: Players choose between different types of weapons or defensive items.
3. Stationary Target Combat System: A mechanism where players engage in combat with fixed-position targets.

### Development Limits

1. Settings are not persisted past server restart.
2. Limited number of weapon choices: To maintain balance.
3. Cooldown period for using healing items: To prevent spamming.

## Implementation

Implementation details will be decided upon proposal acceptance.

## Positive Consequences

- Increased user engagement
- Prolonged interaction within the V-Sekai world
- Enhanced socialization among players

## Negative Consequences

- Potential increase in development time and resources
- Risk of unbalanced gameplay if the RPG system is not properly designed

## Option Graveyard

Options considered but discarded:

- **Idle RPG Mechanic**: Removed due to potential decrease in active engagement from players.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

The frequency of use depends on the players' engagement level. However, given the complexity of an RPG system, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Creating an RPG system as a feature of V-Sekai will enhance the overall user experience and engagement, which aligns with our goal of providing a compelling virtual world.
