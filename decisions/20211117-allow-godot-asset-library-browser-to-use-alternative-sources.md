# Draft: Allow Godot Asset Library browser to use alternative sources

## Context and Problem Statement

Godot Engine has a great asset library browser.

Why can't we reuse it for alternative Godot engine asset libraries?

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Add an alternative server and document the current api as an openapi schema.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Openapi schema for the official asset library api.
1. Elixir server implementation
1. Patch to Godot Engine to add arbitrary asset libraries

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- More freedom.
- Xananax said he'll use it. Xanax's games are made 100% of addons with assets and glue code being the game.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Different libraries

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Could be a few lines of script. Unsure of scope. The server can be a lot too.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Not so core, but I can do it.
