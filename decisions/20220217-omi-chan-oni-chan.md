## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Written steps to vrm rigging #fes256

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Might be still too hard.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: current situation.
- Rejection Reason: No changes.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This uses several plugins of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how to do it!
