## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai, Silent, fire
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The V-Sekai community has identified the need for tools that assist with pivot painting, a technique to enhance animations in game development.

## The Challenge

Silent inquired about available pivot painting tools compatible with our workflow.

## The Strategy

Our strategy involves curating a list of pivot painting resources, documenting best practices, and providing educational content to facilitate their use.

## The Upside

These resources will allow for more complex animations and efficiency gains in our creative process.

## The Downside

Adoption of new tools comes with a learning curve that might slow down initial productivity.

## In Core and Done by Us?

We need to assess whether in-house tool development justifies the required investment based on our pipeline needs.
