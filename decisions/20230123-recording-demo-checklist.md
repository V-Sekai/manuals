Have a checklist of tasks needed for recording demos.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to have consistency for the videos I record.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

- [ ] Do I have a keyboard to screen displayer?
- [ ] Does the video have a V-Sekai logo?
- [ ] Does the video have a work in progress disclaimer?
- [ ] Do I have a time code bar with V-Sekai Game prefix and a timezone suffix? <https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/rtc-timecode-generator.1301/>
