    - ~~I think server works now. I tested editor upload and shard hosting. Only thing missing is setting up Mailer for production and more tests~~
  - **fire:**
    - The discussion centered on automating server tasks (e.g., updating the Downloads section, maps, and avatars) via GitHub Actions while maintaining flexibility and server independence. The choice between GitHub webhooks (using a custom authenticated endpoint) and polling the releases page was debated, with webhooks favored for enabling real-time automation and manual execution via cross-platform `curl` scripts, ensuring tasks could run independently of GitHub. However, concerns about credential management and GitHub dependency were acknowledged, as automated updates via webhooks would stall if GitHub were unavailable, requiring manual intervention. The consensus leaned toward implementing a custom endpoint to unify automated and manual workflows, prioritizing server resilience (ensuring core functions operate even if GitHub is offline) while accepting that automatic updates might occasionally require manual fallbacks. A feature proposal was suggested to formalize this design in the projectâ€™s GitHub repository, balancing GitHub integration with self-sufficient scripting.
