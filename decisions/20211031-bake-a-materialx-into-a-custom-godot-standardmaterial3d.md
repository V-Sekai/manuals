# Draft: Bake a #materialx into a custom Godot StandardMaterial3D

### Context and Problem Statement

There is not many procedural material Makers.

The two the come to mind is Godot's Material Maker and Adobe's Substance Designer.

More options would be helpful.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create a #materialx to Godot Standard Material tool.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Make a GDscript tool that takes the #materialx bake tool I already made and bake it to a standard material 3D in Godot Engine.

Craft a GDScript that uses the command line tool and converts `mtlx` to a standard material 3d.

> `apt install -y libglew-dev`

> `cmake -GNinja .. -DMATERIALX_BUILD_BAKER=ON`

> `.\bin\MaterialXBake.exe --material .\resources\Materials\Examples\glTFPBR\gltf_pbr_boombox.mtlx --bakeFilename ../demo.mtlx --bakeWidth 8192 --bakeHeight 8192`

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Eh. Not simple.

### Positive Consequences

Expansion into a web tool.

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I found an approach and it can be done.
