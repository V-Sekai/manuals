- 2021-06-24 21:34:56Z fire: Talked with Robert from OMI about the useful of a spatial audio emitter extension. There's also a microsoft and a mozilla hub implementation for spatial audio node in wav?, mp3? or ogg? . He had unfinished business with the extension namespace of hubs and wanted to split it.
- 2021-06-23 00:19:33Z lyuma: "<https://github.com/V-Sekai-godot-hop-spin-dance>
  Don't get your hopes up quite yet: A lot of the lower level dependencies for scene packing and t-posing are not converted yet, but the tool scripts work now, so it's a start :-p" üî• (1)
- 2021-06-23 00:19:07Z lyuma: Worked with fire to get the avatar conversion tool updated, using the high level vsk_avatar vsk_vrm_avatar_tool modules: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/857052116593803284/unknown.png>

- 2021-06-22 21:00:23Z fire: We ported the avatar T-Poser to the point the menu popup shows and checkpointed, then concluded for lunch. Multiple modules were ported.
- 2021-06-22 20:56:35Z fire: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2903> Lyuma wrote a proposal
- 2021-06-22 17:33:46Z fire: "Did a 5 minute design for libcurl in Godot Engine. Use
  <https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/C-libcurl> as a template."
- 2021-06-22 17:22:01Z fire: Defined a mantra for groups: `Presence with custom avatars and custom worlds.`
- 2021-06-22 15:55:37Z fire: Updated <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49645> CICD Passes <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/856925406166515722/unknown.png>
- 2021-06-21 13:24:31Z fire: Did I do this wrong? A vs B cs C <https://imgsli.com/NTgzMDk/1/2>
- 2021-06-21 12:40:26Z fire: Good news, the gd_util, math_util and vsk_avatar plugin enables. Now to test it.
- 2021-06-21 03:30:21Z fire: Updated godot-vrm to latest master. <https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm/tree/master> üëç (1)
- 2021-06-20 23:44:26Z Saracen: More fixes to be compatible with the latest master branch. Also making more bug reports for serious issues I encounter üêõ (1),üëç (1)
- 2021-06-20 20:29:37Z fire: It's pretty slow like 7 seconds

- 2021-06-20 20:29:22Z fire: # bc7_enc_rdo
- 2021-06-20 20:29:01Z Saracen: Wow, the existing one is already pretty fast. Good job!

- 2021-06-20 20:28:32Z fire: <https://github.com/fire/godot/tree/faster-cvtt> Lyuma Saracen Faster BPTC compression.
- 2021-06-19 22:42:58Z Saracen: I think I managed to fix the performance issue. It was a badly ported coroutine calling a heavy function continually. Still some issues with pathfinding and abilities not executing, but it's at least actually functioning now.
- 2021-06-19 19:22:18Z Saracen: Further fixes, there's workarounds now for the tool I wrote to extract root motion. Two of the notable bugs I've discovered are ConfigFile.load returning random values and the fact that there doesn't seem to be implicit casting between String and StringName. Want to create some example projects for this. It's also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it's running OBSCENELY slow at the moment. ü¶• (1)
- 2021-06-19 18:01:49Z Saracen: Some more progress on the Amethyst port
- 2021-06-19 07:45:39Z fire: Can now export blends to gltf2 and save as an artifact. Also installs vrm plugin.
- 2021-06-19 07:45:30Z fire: <https://github.com/V-Sekai/blue-tin-fox-models>
- 2021-06-19 00:16:57Z fire: Discussed with Saracen and Acquaintances to add a female mannequin to add colored characters.
- 2021-06-18 21:01:16Z fire: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49717>
- 2021-06-18 20:15:22Z lyuma: That's a bug with shadow mesh actually
- 2021-06-18 20:14:42Z fire: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49706>
- 2021-06-18 10:29:49Z lyuma: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/855393862876790804/avp_living.jpg>
- 2021-06-18 10:28:07Z lyuma: There are still things missing, of course: for example, some materials like the walls use a custom shader with nonstandard property names... but the overall scene structure does get imported! üëè (3)
- 2021-06-18 10:27:51Z lyuma: I'm proud to announce that Unidot Importer was finally able to import the "Vol. 6" AirBnB House without any major errors! <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/855393367545085983/unknown.png>

- 2021-06-17 17:01:09Z fire: !!!
- 2021-06-17 16:59:42Z Saracen: I pushed an experimental branch of Amethyst designed to work in 4.0 upstream to a new branch. The behavior tree is still broken though.
- 2021-06-16 23:24:26Z fire: <https://github.com/fire/godot/tree/bc7enc_rdo> Updated
- 2021-06-16 23:23:49Z fire: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49669> Lyuma not sure if it's the crash

- 2021-06-12 22:26:57Z fire: I think I'm breaking lyuma's server
- 2021-06-12 22:26:21Z fire: Godot Engine 4 and Groups 4.x builds have been flowing for the last day or so on itchio
- 2021-06-12 22:16:36Z fire: Chatted with youwin with Lyuma and did work on gdopenseeface, gltf and godot-vrm
- 2021-06-12 22:16:09Z fire: Chatted with <https://twitter.com/CaptainProton42> and joined a few repositories
- 2021-06-11 22:07:17Z fire: <https://github.com/Tom94/tev> !
- 2021-06-11 03:46:06Z lyuma: Updated the `@export` fix for a third time. It's amazing how many different ways there are to fix bit operations on a single line of code
- 2021-06-11 03:45:26Z lyuma: Updated shader_improvements_meta_3.x branch for latest 3.x godot so someone could try SCSS (I want to keep it for historical purposes). I'm not going to update 4.x because it's in flux and too much churn with renames to keep anything working
- 2021-06-11 03:44:54Z lyuma: Found a bug in MToon, related to a line of code that flips the normal if it's pointing backwards from the view direction (you can see this if you look at an MToon face with custom normals from a sharp direction).
- 2021-06-10 22:56:30Z fire: Restoring the CICD builds for godot 4. I did the changes, but currently verifying that it builds on Groups 4.x and then I'll try github.com/godotengine@master
- 2021-06-10 03:11:20Z fire: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845777129605300255/852383622606094346/unknown.png> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845777129605300255/852383560882323487/unknown.png> I tested compute graphs earlier. This is is the important part. I can now start a github action, start a kubernetes server, start a argo server, start an alpine linux image, have a whale message a hello world and then save it as a file and have it be download as a github artifact
- 2021-06-09 20:50:29Z lyuma: "I tried baking lighting in the ""AirBNB"" and ran into this error:
  > WARNING: Inconsistency found in triangulation while building BSP, probe interpolation quality may degrade a bit.
  > at: LightmapGI::\_compute_bsp_tree (scene\3d\lightmap_gi.cpp:460)
  >
  > Jfons informed me it is an issue with separating tetrahedrons. The scene has 2641 light probes so there's probably something suspect there. I'll have to look into it further. I think I have an idea: we have to make sure there are probes above and below to form a complete tetrahedron"
- 2021-06-09 20:49:09Z lyuma: "Summary about lightmap UV problem: Mesh scale & import scale matters when dealing with lightmaps. There were bugs reading the scale, but now that is fixed and the issue with losing polygons will only happen on triangles with 1e-7 edge length in world space.

The issue with removing mesh edges still exists, in theory, but in practice it seems unlikely so let's wait and see if it shows up in the wild and then we can take another look"

- 2021-06-09 18:07:18Z lyuma: Due to a glitch in Godot's etcpak implementation, I had to use BPTC texture compression. It took 3-4 hours to compress all the textures :-p (I can't use uncompressed textures because VRAM isn't free and I don't own a 3090) godette (1)
- 2021-06-09 18:06:25Z lyuma: so it's bound to improve further. it's pretty fun seeing this place come together
- 2021-06-09 18:06:04Z lyuma: A lot of objects are missing material assignments due to naming rules (for example " - " or " #" in filenames
- 2021-06-09 18:05:39Z lyuma: I know it's not the v-sekai 4.x port but I took a break from it to work a bit more on fixing import issues: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/852247085931298896/unknown.png>
