A tech demo is a great way to showcase the capabilities of a platform, but it's just that - a demonstration. It doesn't fully utilize the potential of the platform or provide a comprehensive user experience. By developing a full game project, we can truly show what our platform is capable of and give users an immersive, engaging experience.
