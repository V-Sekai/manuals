## Context and Problem Statement

There is no process for previewing #materialx on the web.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Propose using Godot Engine 4.0 as a WebGL2 previewer for MaterialX.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Compile Godot Engine 4.0 for WebGL2
1. Make a 2D app
1. Export to the Itch.io web store.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Can use the same code base as the rest

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Godot monopolizing yet another platform.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This requires devops.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Can be outside of core.
