# Draft: Import Minecraft worlds to Godot Engine

### Context and Problem Statement

We want more content in Godot Engine.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to import Minecraft worlds as .Vox and as standard gltf.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Save the minecraft world.

Use `amulet_map_editor`.

1. git clone <https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Map-Editor.git>
1. cd Amulet-Map-Editor
1. python3 -m pip install amulet-map-editor
1. python3 -m amulet_map_editor
1. Use wxpython 4.x
1. export world to .schematic
1. use FileToVox
1. Use fire's vox module for godot 4.x

Use Schematic and Mineways and export to .obj.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a small number of lines.

### Positive Consequences

More content!

### Negative Consequences

Workflow changes.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Can remix work by Zylann and others.
