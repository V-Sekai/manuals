# Draft: Solve Mocap By Connecting Mediapipe to Blender

## Context and Problem Statement

Want to animate a blender file with mediapipe

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

By writing a c++ executable on Linux, we can connect Mediapipe to Blender.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Create a wrapper for <https://github.com/infosia/vmc2bvh/tree/master/osc>
2. Install Blender addon <https://github.com/maybites/blender.NodeOSC>
3. Convert python script to c++
4. Make c++ buildable by bazel
5. Build executables on Github Actions

#### Design loop

1. <https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11> for command line parsing
2. <https://github.com/infosia/vmc2bvh/blob/master/code/Vmc2Bvh.cpp> for example code
3. For each process send osc to node osc (Blender).
4. Create a structure for the messages

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

ML and armature work is hard

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?
