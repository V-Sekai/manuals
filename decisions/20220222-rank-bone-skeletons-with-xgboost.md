# Accepted: Rank skeleton #bone names with xgboost

- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->

## Context and Problem Statement

Improve automatic #bone selection

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use xgboost to rank bones.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Investigate

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- We can guess the proper name.
- Useful for the facial mapping problem?
- Useful for the character generator slider recommendation problem?
- Generate test data by moving the character
- Inference requires only single pose inputs.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Starring at the abyss.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option:
  - bpr from Quora
- Rejection Reason:

  - Bpr from Quora is not used in production.

- Option:
  - dlrm from facebook
- Rejection Reason:

  - Too difficult to run

- Option:
  - catboost
- Rejection Reason:
  - Too difficult to run

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need this to make the quality of life of creators better.
