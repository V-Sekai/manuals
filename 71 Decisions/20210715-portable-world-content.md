# Proposed: Portable #world Content

### Context and Problem Statement

Independent meta-verses (virtual worlds) lack content because their communities are too small to fund much content work.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Collaborate with Mozilla Hub's Spoke Editor and OMI Group's glTF2 extensions to have portable #world content.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Provide basic glTF2 extensions. Here is an initial list.

1. URI scene linking
2. Archive binary format
3. Audio emitters

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

There are many moving parts and a web client, which is not a few lines of code.

### Positive Consequences

- Easier creation of new virtual worlds.
- Encourage remixing content
- Keeping old content portable to new virtual #world

### Negative Consequences

- Have to find different monetization means for independent virtual #world

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

No one is doing it.
