# Accepted: To have an alternative CICD use Github Actions

- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

GitHub actions is free and does not require running your own hardware for CI/CD.
We understand some users may desire to use this route to build our system.

However, we also want our system to be fully self hosted, so as a compromise,
we may wish to offer first-party support for both types of continuous integration.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We will offer github actions files in our official Godot fork as well as our V-Sekai project.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We will generate github actions templates using the same jsonnet we use for GoCD.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- The social network of GitHub is more accessible to most people.
- Offers more options for building our infrastructure and ways to get into Godot development, which is good.
- GitHub's donated compute time may free up valuable compute resources for more critical operations.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Maintaining more scripts requires our developer time
- More codepaths means more QA or pieces that can break.

## Option graveyard

- Option: Keep the status quo, which is using GoCD or building manually on the command line.
- Rejection Reason: Building manually on the command line is slow on Windows and not reproducible;
- Rejection Reason: GoCD is inaccessible to most developers.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

It can.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We want to maintain it to encourage developers and as the publisher of the platform it is our responsibility.
