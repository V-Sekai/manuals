## Context and Problem Statement

Wanted to scale V-Sekai.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Need find options to learn how to scale V-Sekai.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Bots
2. Multiplier ghosts

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- We dream of more players.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Painful engineering.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Paying $250 for 400 players per event.
- Rejection Reason: Would work for a venture funded company in the Bay Area but hard for an opensoruce project.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is an end to end integration test and it is trivial to setup bot creating but runs through all the systems.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We depend on the player load performance.
