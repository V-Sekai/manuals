### Context and Problem Statement

How do we start our uro backend?

**USE [20220531-elixir-uro-dev.md](20220531-elixir-uro-dev.md) for the production URO**

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Write documentation how to update elixir.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Compile uro. You will need Elixir installed.

I recommend getting the latest, but for these steps, I am using Elixir v1.14.4.

Download Uro from <https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro>

We are using the dev environment. It is the default, but you can also set `MIX_ENV=dev`.

To compile HTML/CSS webpack:

```
cd assets
npm install
npm run deploy
cd ..
```

If the compile gives issues, you can run it multiple times. To compile dependencies:

```bash
mix do compile, phx.digest
```

If one of them gives an error due to `nmake` or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a `x64 Native Tools command prompt` from visual studio and run
`mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir`

Finally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:

```bash
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
iex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server
```

This will start uro at <http://localhost:4000/>

Create a user in the website register user page.

Go to the console and set the user to be admin.

```bash
iex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server
# TODO
# Call Uro.Accounts.update_user_as_admin
```

[GitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir ...](https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro)

The docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.

Then, go to DockerHub at <https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags> and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).

Now, edit the flux config at <https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml> and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.

Check that uro-deployment was updated.

### Positive Consequences

We're able to update uro!

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Option graveyard

_No response_

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

It's arguably a few lines of script, but it's our script!

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain the website.
