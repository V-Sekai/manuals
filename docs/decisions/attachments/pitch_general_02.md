# V-Sekai's main goals and features

V-Sekai wants to make virtual collaboration easy for everyone by focusing on bringing people together and enabling creation.

With open voice and text chat, you can hang out and talk to others freely. Customize your VRM 1.0 avatar to represent yourself and feel like you're among friends no matter where they are.

Our simple spaces provide locations for any activity. You can discuss ideas in a casual lounge, brainstorm on interactive whiteboards, design together in a 3D workshop, or build fully customized environments.

In V-Sekai, you can express yourself by sharing and creating things together. You can doodle and prototype on the digital whiteboard or with 3D modeling tools. Bring in images, videos, web content, anything - then combine them into new inventions. You can create alone or with friends to keep improving each other's work.

We know that new platforms need good tutorials. That's why we make collaborating in V-Sekai simple, with friendly walkthroughs and a helpful community. We built this platform for you, and we listen and update regularly based on what the community wants to create.

At V-Sekai, we believe in open access. We are developing ways for outside creators to build new tools, spaces, and features that expand V-Sekai's potential. We follow our values of empowering users, spreading joy, and helping shape this open world!

V-Sekai provides space, freedom, and fertile ground for relationships to flourish. The essentials for hanging out with friends in a virtual world are simple enough for everyone yet open for spontaneous interaction and creating together. We build the foundation, and you provide the imagination. Join us in building the future of social VR!
