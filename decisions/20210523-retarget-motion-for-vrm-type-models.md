# Draft: Retarget VRM Motion Blender Workflow

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to retarget motion for VRM type models.

This is a lengthy offline process to retarget other motions to VRM type models.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use Blender to retarget t-posed characters.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

- Inputs: bvh + t-pose avatar
- Output: glb w/retargetted animation

#### Requirements

- Blender v2.91 or v2.92 (may work with other versions)
- Blender Add-On: [skeletal-motion-retarget-blender](https://github.com/fire/skeletal-motion-retarget-blender)
  - Download .zip
  - Use Blender Edit => Preferences, Add-ons, Install that zip
  - Check the box for the new install an add-on to activate
- (optional) if using a VRM avatar Blender Add-On: [saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender/releases/)
  - Download .zip
  - Use Blender Edit => Preferences, Add-ons, Install that zip
  - Check the box for the newly install an add-on to activate

### Conversion Process

- Have a rigged, T-Pose humanoid avatar
- Start a new scene?
  - Under the Scene Settings property panel, set Frame Rate to 30 fps
  - (or you may want to match your .mp4 frame rate used during capture)
- Import your avatar model
  - if using a VRM avatar, be sure to use Import VRM (otherwise, retargeting may not work!)
- Import the generated BVH. In the Animation section, enable the following options
  - [x] Scale FPS
  - [x] Scene Duration
- Use the Pose Transfer tab (vertical tab part of the "N" options panel?)
  - Source: the imported BVH armature
  - Target: the imported avatar armature
  - Click the Rebuild Bone List
    - manually map over any bones not automatically mapped
    - eg: LeftLowerArm => "Left elbow"
    - note: it is possible to save your mapping to .json and reuse
  - Click Retarget Animation
    - retargeting may take several minutes
- Verify retargeting by playing the animation via the Blender play button
- Export the scene as a .glb (using default settings)

### Common Problems

Q: Retargeted animation seems to have legs crossed / backwards

A: This can happen if you import a VRM avatar as a .gltf (re-import using the VRM importer add-on)

Q: Legs/arms bend unnaturally

A: Check the armature bone name mappings

- at most, each target bone name should appear once
- leave BVH joints not present in your avatar blank

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Have a generally robust process of retargeting motions to VRM-type models.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Only VRM
- MMD does not work.

## Option graveyard: Adobe Mixamo

List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)

- Proprietary Online Service
- Blackbox technology

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Motion retargeting is not trivial offline or online.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need motions for our character controller without using an off-the-shelf black box solution.
