# Draft: Provide pdf reading

### Context and Problem Statement

Provide a workflow to read pdf documents.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to provide pdf reading without implementing a pdf reader.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Convert pdf into a series of svgs (raster + vector)
1. Put svgs in a folder
1. Clean with <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner>
1. Use godot engine 4's thorvg

### Positive Consequences

Can import artwork.

### Negative Consequences

Not a real pdf viewer.

### Option graveyard

Do nothing.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

A few lines of cli.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Wanted to write the workflow down.
