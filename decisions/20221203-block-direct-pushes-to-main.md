- Status: rejected <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,
- Tags: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

Direct push to main cause build breakage.

Note: This has been rejected by Lyuma.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We block direct pushes to the main and use pull requests and merges.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use the GitHub workflow with pull requests.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

We don't have to wait 2 hours to see if our changes break the build.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

There are consequences of increased developer merging friction.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: We keep breaking the build. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a dev ops change.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the GitHub repositories.
