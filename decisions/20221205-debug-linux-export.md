# Draft: Debug Linux Export

## Context and Problem Statement

It is hard to debug exports on Linux without using Linux as a desktop environment. There is a crash on export.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Propose a workflow for debugging linux exports.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use wsl or a virtual machine.

1. Download the exact version of the editor that crashes on export.
2. Download the game templates.
3. Run the export in a debugger
4. Find the bug.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

1. We can export again
2. Writing down the workflow makes use be able to reuse processes.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

We need to download the binaries manually for now.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

- Option: Compile the package manually <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing because it is all manually and undocumented <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a workflow document.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We have to build V-Sekai.
