## The Backdrop

The player starts with a hovercar and uses an upgrade to transform it into a hover submarine for ocean exploration. This involves navigating through surreal landscapes, encountering storms, avoiding volcanic eruptions, exploring coral reefs, and finally reaching a new island.

## The Challenge

The main challenge lies in transitioning from land to underwater exploration while maintaining an engaging experience for the player. Creating diverse and interactive environments such as the cyber surrealist/impressionist voxel blocks landscape and the vibrant coral reef poses its own set of challenges.

## The Strategy

We can use voxel-based rendering for creating the surreal landscapes and procedural generation for creating diverse marine life in the coral reef. For the transition from hovercar to hover submarine, we can design a special animation sequence that showcases the transformation.

## The Upside

Implementing this would result in a unique and engaging gaming experience that combines elements of exploration, adventure, and survival. It would also showcase the capabilities of V-Sekai in creating diverse and immersive virtual worlds.

## The Downside

The complexity involved in implementing the proposed features would require significant resources and expertise. There's also a risk that the final product may not meet the expectations due to technical limitations or unforeseen challenges.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to simplify the journey by limiting the number of environments or removing the transformation aspect. However, this would likely result in a less engaging experience for the player.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this proposal aligns with the core values of V-Sekai and can be implemented by our team with the right resources and planning.
