## Context and Problem Statement

Design a 4m x 4m x 5m Aquarium Nightclub themed booth.

## Proposed Solution

Create an immersive environment combining aquarium and nightclub elements, including aquatic decorations, lighting, interactivity, a hostess, and ambient music.

### Key Features

1. **Aquatic-themed decorations**: Use 3D models of marine life, such as fish, corals, and seaweed, to create a colourful underwater environment.
2. Implement the ambience of a nightclub.
3. **Interactive elements**: Add interactive components, such as touch-sensitive screens or motion sensors, to allow visitors to interact with the marine life and control the lighting effects.
4. **Jellyfish Hostess**:
   - **JellyBell**: Enchanting hostess engaging visitors in the booth experience.
   - **Iridescent Gown**: Amplifies her aquatic charm with sheer fabric and ribbons
5. **Ambient music**: Include background music that complements the aquarium and nightclub themes.

## Implementation

1. Design and model 3D assets.
2. Implement interactive elements.
3. Add hostess character.
4. Integrate ambient music.

## Positive Consequences

- Unique and engaging theme attracts visitors.
- Immersive experience combines education and entertainment.
- Encourages interaction and exploration.
- Hostess enhances visitor engagement.

## Negative Consequences

- Requires significant development time and resources.
- Balancing two themes may be challenging.
- Integrating dynamic lighting and shaders may require extra effort.

## Option Graveyard

- Static environment without interactivity.
- Focusing on one theme only.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, requires significant design and development work.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Creating a unique booth is essential for attracting visitors and showcasing VR development capabilities.
