# V-Sekai Changelog - 2022-08

## Lyuma — 04/08/2022

Migrated vsk_avatar and vsk_vrm_avatar_tool to import retargeter. There is still pending work to apply the 180 degree rotation during VRM import but we're pretty close. Newly uploaded avatars should work, but after we fix the z-forward issue we may want to upload again.
