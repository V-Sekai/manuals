# Draft: Neural Blend Shape Rigging

### Context and Problem Statement

Rigging characters takes too much effort and skill.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use Neural Blend Shapes to rig a base mesh.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

#### Requirements

1. t-pose base mesh
2. Similar to the smpl_std.

#### Get neural Blend shapes

Clone neural blend shapes

`git clone https://github.com/PeizhuoLi/neural-blend-shapes.git`

#### Blender

1. Open your base mesh
2. Open the smpl_std.obj into the Blender mesh
3. Enable the mesh align Blender addon
4. Select the rest of the meshes and then the smpl_std mesh
5. Align base_mesh.obj to the base mesh and then translate it so it stands on the floor

#### Neural Blend Shapes

```bash
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh
mamba create --name neural python=3.7
mamba activate neural
mamba install tensorboard tqdm PyTorch torchvision torchaudio -c PyTorch -y
python demo.py --pose_file=./eval_constant/sequences/house-dance.npy --obj_path=./eval_constant/meshes/ALPAPAAM.obj --normalize=1 --animated_bvh=1 --obj_output=0
sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
sudo flatpak install org.blender.Blender
cd blender_scripts
flatpak run org.blender.Blender -b -P `pwd`/nbs_fbx_output.py -- --input `pwd`/../demo --output `pwd`/../demo/output.fbx
```

#### Use voxel diffuse skinning

1. The skeleton model above weighted the eye area. This is not good.
2. Use <https://www.blendermarket.com/products/voxel-heat-diffuse-skinning>
3. Take skeleton from output.fbx and reweight it onto the original mesh set

#### VRM

![image](attachments/125210653-0b533780-e256-11eb-8758-caeca92a16e2.png)

1. Set bone mappings
2. In the scripting set first person json to use bone "22" for the head
3. TODO Move the skeleton so it stands on the floor

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not workaround-able.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

No finger support yet.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Mixamo is a black box and V-Sekai would be more robust to have an alternative.
