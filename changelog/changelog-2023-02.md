# V-Sekai Changelog - 2023-02

This is the changelog for Feburary 2023.

The sdk has the entire v-sekai-game project, all the builds and git .

The game builds can be smaller but they currently have the shared_library, the executable and the gdextension interface files. It also can launch v-sekai with openxr. 

The builds are ranging to 10 minutes for a partially cached build on average. Engine builds take longer.

## People

1. Someone wanted me to help out on voip so I assisted
2. A v-tuber, expiredpopsicle, is using godot-vrm! and contributed.
3. Faolan is a Godot contribtor. Fire gifted libgodot code to him and now he's able to run his vr platform on the Meta Quest with dotnet.

## Fire

I reduced iteration times on the V-Sekai cicd from 1.5 hours to 2-10 minutes. 

I also stopped merging incomplete work. Every merge commit should stand on its own.
