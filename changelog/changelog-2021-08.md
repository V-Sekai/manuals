# V-Sekai Changelog - 2021-08

- 2021-08-31 23:04:24Z fire: Did a few hours of work learning Blender with Cleam last night. Did some testing of Tokage's skeleton gizmo.
- 2021-08-30 17:09:35Z MMMaellon#2053 nice
- 2021-08-30 16:13:28Z Saracen: Got MMMaellon's RenIK system compiling for 4.x now. It's also worth noting that the new SkeletonModifierStack is now mainlined in 4.0, so my next task with this will be to port RenIK to using this system. The final step will be porting it to the new GDExtension system as that becomes more viable
- 2021-08-30 02:31:12Z fire: updated our engine + AUTHORITY changes + libcurl
- 2021-08-28 22:01:33Z fire: Left is blend shape / right is bones. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/881297479033827388/2021-08-28_15-00-45.mp4
- 2021-08-28 21:52:02Z fire: I got dembones working. `./DemBones -i="Face_Geom.fbx" -a="Face_Anim.abc" --bindUpdate=2 -o="Decomposition_20_grouped_face.fbx" --nnz=8 -b=256` Note that the corresponding fbx is 0.01 scale while the alembic is in meters. The RMSE = 0.00433256 must be this low. Especially do not pass DemBones if the RMSE is like 3.5. Next thing is to integrate an existing 3d skeleton.
- 2021-08-28 21:28:03Z fire: Jonbonazza said he resolved the ipv6 dns problem and the last remaining steps are to get to build for all platforms. Details for a future iFire.
