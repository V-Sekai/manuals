## Context and Problem Statement

Powershell was updated and there is auto complete. However, the exact prediction command is unknown.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Document that powershell autocomplete uses the right arrow.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Write down that right arrow completes the prediction.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

Can auto complete.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Documentation is work.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

None.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I wanted to write this down and it's not a core thing.
