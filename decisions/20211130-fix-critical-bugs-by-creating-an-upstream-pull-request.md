# Accepted: Create an upstream pull request for all non-V-Sekai related patches

- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,
- Tags: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

We use a gitassembler script, but the list may diverge from Godot Engine master.

These critical changes need to be synced with Godot Engine organization.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Non-V-Sekai related and upstreamable godot patches should be filed as upstream PRs.

This makes Godot Engine core and V-Sekai better because changes are synchronized.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Here is an example `.gitassembly`:

```
stage groups-web-4.x remotes/v-sekai-godot/master
merge groups-web-4.x remotes/lyuma/gltf_shapes_8bones
merge groups-web-4.x remotes/v-sekai-godot/ninja-ccache
```

Need to check every line in the list using a comparison link:

- <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/master...lyuma:gltf_shapes_8bones>
- <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/master...v-sekai-godot:ninja-ccache>

Make a corresponding pull request on <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls> if there isn't one.

If not possible, or non-upstreamable (for example, V-Sekai related), leave a comment in the `.gitassembly` why one cannot create a Godot Engine organization pull request.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- synced
- easier maintenance

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- need to pay cost of bureaucracy

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: do nothing
- Rejection Reason: V-Sekai and Godot Engine organization diverge

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Godot Engine code is core.
