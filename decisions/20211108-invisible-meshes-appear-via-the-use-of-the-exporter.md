## Context and Problem Statement

Polish the demo of V-Sekai

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to validate the V-Sekai exporter addon works.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Validate the broken V-Sekai scene exporter addon.
1. Export test scene.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Remove the high priority bug of the missing meshes.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Work on making the text have higher texel density.
- Rejection Reason: Is time consuming and not as priority.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

The is core V-Sekai.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Only we can set the initial scene.
