# Draft: Integrate with blender

- Status: Draft <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

Blend files are too difficult to write an importer for in Godot Engine.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Make an addon that calls Blender directly and tell it to export to the proper place.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Enable addon
1. Open blend
1. See the blend as a Godot Engine scene.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Integrates Blender into Godot Engine workflows.
- Downside of Blender version updates can be fixed by the use of the V-Sekai exporter tool.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Requires blender to export cicd.
- Changes to the Blender version causes the project to desync.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

- This is a script but not a few lines.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how to do this and others don't.
