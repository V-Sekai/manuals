## Context and Problem Statement

File or attestation for virtual worlds

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use ssh signatures.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

An analogy of a CD and a CD case with stickers.

### File attestation

Read your public key.

```
ssh-add -L > me.pub # Can be related to a X.509 `.crt`
```

Create a file.

```
touch avatar-sample.vrm
```

Sign your file.

```
ssh-keygen -Y sign -f <(ssh-add -L) -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" < avatar-sample.vrm >> avatar-sample.vrm.avatar%40V-sekai.com.sig
ssh-keygen -Y sign -f <(ssh-add -L) -n "me@v-sekai.org" < avatar-sample.vrm >> avatar-sample.vrm.me%40V-sekai.com.sig
```

Write signature to avatar-sample.vrm.sig # Can be attested by multiple people with multiple `.sig`.

```
echo -n ernest.lee@chibifire.com | cat - <(echo -n " ") | cat - <(ssh-add -L) > allowed_signers # Can have more than o
ne line.
```

The allowed_signers file associates a string that represents a person (Principle) to a Public Key.

```
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I ernest.lee@chibifire.com -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" -s avatar-sample.vrm.avatar%40V-sekai.com.sig < avatar-sample.vrm
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I ernest.lee@chibifire.com -n "me@v-sekai.org" -s  avatar-sample.vrm.me%40V-sekai.com.sig < avatar-sample.vrm
```

### Create SSH Certificates to delegate roles

```bash
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# or smartcard
# TODO: How do you change authorization of the delegation?
ssh-keygen -Us <(ssh-add -L) -I fire@example.com -n avatar@V-Sekai.com -V +1h KEYFILE.pub
```

### Distributing keys

```bash
# Resulting file is namespace.allowed_signers but uri_encoded.
curl https://github.com/fire.keys > avatars%40V-Sekai.com.allowed_signers # Needs a id in email syntax in front of a key
curl files://uro > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
curl http://matrix-homeserver.example.com/fire > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to distribute a game launcher.
- Able to add a makers mark to items.
- Use for verifying binaries
- Use for verifying game modifications
- Used for lobby servers to prove to the player that they are official.
- Double sided friending

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- No data encryption

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Matrix
- Rejection Reason: Technically complicated to devops start and multiple layers compared to an offline approach.

- Option: Ipfs and Etherium
- Rejection Reason: Requires a globally distributed database.

- Option: Sigstore <https://www.sigstore.dev/>
- Rejection Reason: Why aren't we using sigstore?

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not able to use a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We have to define the trust.
