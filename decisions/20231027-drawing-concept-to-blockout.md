# Proposed: Drawing Concept to Blockout

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai, fire
- **Tags:** V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

The goal is to add more finished vrms to V-Sekai.

## The Challenge

The task at hand is to create some concept art for an existing VRoid character model.

## The Strategy

Here's the proposed strategy:

1. Start with greyscale outlines to focus on shapes rather than color.
2. Use a off-white background, an outline color, a shadow color and a solid color.
3. Focus on the overall shapes and silhouette first before adding details.

## The Upside

This process will help nail down the overall look and feel before getting distracted by details and color. Starting with outlines and simple shapes will make it easier to iterate quickly.

## The Downside

The downside could be that focusing too much on the overall shape might lead to neglecting the finer details which are also important in character design. Also, this approach may not work as effectively for complex designs.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to start with detailed sketches instead of broad shapes. This would allow for more detail early on but could potentially slow down the iteration process.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This method might not be suitable if the character design is already well established and does not require significant changes to its overall shape and structure.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this is a core part of our design process and is done by us.
