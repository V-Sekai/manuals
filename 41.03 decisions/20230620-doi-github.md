# Proposed: A Potential Solution for V-Sekai's Identifier Assignment Challenge

## Metadata

- Status: proposed
- Deciders: V-Sekai, fire

## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai requires a method to assign permanent Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to their digital artifacts.

## Suggested Solution

Leverage Github and Zenodo to create a permanent DOI for V-Sekai's data and code.

## Implementation

Follow these steps in the guide below:

1.  Set up a Github Repository
2.  Connect Github to Zenodo
3.  Activate Github Repository in Zenodo
4.  Generate a Release in Github
5.  Obtain Your DOI from Zenodo
6.  Showcase DOI Badge in Github README (optional)

## Positive Consequences

- Persistent DOIs for data and code
- Effortless referencing of repositories across browsers
- Enhanced visibility and accessibility of V-Sekai's digital artifacts

## Negative Consequences

- Necessitates managing multiple platforms (Github and Zenodo)
- Possible learning curve for users unfamiliar with Github and Zenodo

## Alternative Options

1.  **Utilizing Figshare**: Figshare is an alternative platform that enables assigning DOIs to digital artifacts. However, its integration with Github may not be as smooth as Zenodo's.

2.  **Manual DOI registration**: Manually registering a DOI through agencies like DataCite or CrossRef. This option can be labor-intensive and might involve additional fees.

3.  **Depending on publisher-assigned DOIs**: Some publishers allocate DOIs to supplementary materials during article publication. However, this option relies on the publisher's policies and may not encompass all digital artifacts.

4.  **Employing institutional repositories**: Certain institutions provide their own repositories for hosting digital artifacts and assigning DOIs. This option could be constrained by institutional policies and access limitations.

5.  **No DOI**: Opting not to assign a DOI to V-Sekai's digital artifacts, which would complicate referencing and long-term accessibility.

## Can this enhancement be worked around with a few lines of script if used infrequently?

No, this solution demands integration between Github and Zenodo to produce a permanent DOI.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and implemented by us?

Yes, allocating a permanent DOI to V-Sekai's digital artifacts guarantees long-term accessibility and accurate referencing in publications or other materials.
