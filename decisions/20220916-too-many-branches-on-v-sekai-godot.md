# Draft: We have too many branches on V-Sekai/godot

### Context and Problem Statement

We have too many branches on V-Sekai/godot.

A lot of branches are already merged, some are godot 3.x, some were for old alphas.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create a procedure for deleting branches.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We should be able to delete merged branches after we remove it from merge script or move the branches to an archive repo with all the PRs.

\<lyuma> It's definitely ok to delete when godot merges . you can still get the commit hash by `git log | grep v-sekai/branchname` in godotengine/godot.

### Positive Consequences

Less confusion.

### Negative Consequences

Accidentally deleting a used branch.

### Option graveyard

Do nothing.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not applicable.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the V-Sekai/godot repository.
