# Accepted: Bolster creating the metaverse

- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->

## Context and Problem Statement

The metaverse needs creators.

> Open Metaverse Interoperability Group's mission: We bolster the metaverse as an open and interoperable resource for anyone, inspired by the collaborative efforts of the community.

> The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.
> OMI Core Values

> We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
>
> We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent.
>
> We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation.
>
> We empower the people making the metaverse.
>
> We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We propose to create a V-Sekai #guide to creating the metaverse, creating your own virtual you and creating a part of the world. This can be a collaboration with others to provide matching #guide to other metaverses.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Learn from how experienced educators how to bloster new creators.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- More creators are available.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Effort and time are spent for unknown results.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option:
<!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason:
<!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a coding script, but can be a #guide script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Only we can create official V-Sekai guides.
