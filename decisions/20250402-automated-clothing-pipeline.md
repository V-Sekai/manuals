# Proposed: Automated Clothing Pipeline

## Context

This proposal outlines an integrated system for clothing detection, recommendation, generation, and quality assurance. Key metrics include real-time processing latency (<50ms), recommendation accuracy (>85% user satisfaction), and defect detection recall (>90%). The system addresses growing demands in virtual fashion markets by combining computer vision, recommendation systems, and procedural content generation.

## Problem Statement

Key challenges include:

1. High computational cost of real-time clothing detection on edge devices
2. Cold-start problem for personalized recommendations
3. Manual effort in 3D clothing asset creation
4. Difficulty detecting rare defects in skinned meshes

## Proposed Solution

Four interconnected modules using unified metadata:
**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Task A**: Optimize RF-DETR with IREE compiler for edge deployment
2. **Task B**: Build PinSage-based recommender with multi-tag support
3. **Task C**: Develop Blender/Marvelous Designer automation pipeline
4. **Task D**: Train defect detection model with synthetic data

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core System Development (Weeks 1-6)
   - Validate IREE compatibility for deformable attention
   - Implement split_multi_value in librecommender
   - Create Blender defect injection scripts
   - [Roboflow] Create clothing classification dataset with style/color annotations
2. **Phase 2**: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 7-10)
   - Deploy edge-optimized RF-DETR on Jetson AGX
   - Establish Godot/Unreal asset pipeline
   - Benchmark defect detection F1 scores
   - [Roboflow] Generate synthetic defect dataset using Blender Python API
3. **Validation**:
   - Success Criteria: <20ms inference latency, >85% recommendation accuracy
   - Failure Threshold: >30% performance drop vs baseline

## Benefits

- 10x faster clothing asset creation vs manual workflows
- Unified metadata flow from detection to 3D generation
- Real-time operation on consumer-grade hardware
- Automated QA for production-ready 3D models

## Risks and Limitations

| Risk                           | Mitigation                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| IREE compilation failures      | Maintain PyTorch fallback implementation        |
| Physics simulation instability | Implement Marvelous Designer safety constraints |
| Rare defect false positives    | Active learning with human-in-the-loop          |

## Alternatives Considered

| Option                  | Pros             | Cons                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| YOLOv8                  | Faster inference | Lower mAP on small accessories |
| TensorFlow Recommenders | Mature ecosystem | No native multi-tag support    |

## When to Avoid

Not suitable for high-fashion detail reproduction requiring manual artistry.

## Organizational Alignment

Supports virtual commerce initiatives and aligns with open-source 3D tooling roadmap.
