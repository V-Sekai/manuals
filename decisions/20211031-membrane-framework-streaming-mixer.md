# Draft: Membrane Framework streaming Mixer

### Context and Problem Statement

I want to stream 3d content to godot engine live.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Currently having an import and export pipeline that isn't live is frustrating.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

- Find a stable version of Blender
- Use mixer plugin with that stable version
- Make Godot Engine sync plugin
- ???
- Make a mixer sync server
- Create python pickle packet

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I found this idea and its cool.
