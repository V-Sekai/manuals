# V-Sekai Changelog - September 2023

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ported RenIK to GDScript, providing a reference implementation and allowing for separation of RenIKPlacement from RenIK as two distinct nodes. This change enables reuse of the foot placement implementation on any other IK system or swapping out the foot placement system for another animation system and then running the IK algorithm independently. The port was challenging due to differences in the Basis APIs between C++ and GDScript. The GDScript code is available at [https://github.com/V-Sekai/renik/tree/gdscript](https://github.com/V-Sekai/renik/tree/gdscript) and can be used instead of the original C++ version at [https://github.com/V-Sekai/renik](https://github.com/V-Sekai/renik). It includes a test scene for use in projects.
