# Draft: Tire model car sim

### Context and Problem Statement

Create a vehicle simulation

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use physx's tire simulation. While citing their mit license.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Use math model.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

One does not simply make a vehicle sim.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Maybe out of scope? But I have an approach.
