## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is an open-source project that aims to create a virtual world. However, it has some limitations that need to be addressed to improve its performance and user experience.

## The Challenge

The main challenge is to update the V-Sekai game engine to enhance its features and fix existing issues.

## The Strategy

Here are the steps we propose to take:

1. Update the Godot Engine fork with git assembler.
2. Release the fork to the godot engine branch.
