# Draft: Run the maintenance scripts from Windows in Unix mode with msys2

- Status: Draft <-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->

## Context and Problem Statement

I want to use Unix tools but the experience of Linux is lacking.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use msys2 on Windows to improve this.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

- Install Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Open Powershell.
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser`
- `iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex`
- `scoop install msys`
- `msys2` Restart to setup msys2.
- `pacman -S ssh-pageant openssh git python3`
- Copy to ~/.bashrc
- `eval $(/usr/bin/ssh-pageant -r -a "/tmp/.ssh-pageant-$USERNAME")`

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]
- […]

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option:
<!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason:
<!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a quality of life improvement.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I use this.
