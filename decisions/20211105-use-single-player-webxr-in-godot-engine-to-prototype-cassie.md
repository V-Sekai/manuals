## Context and Problem Statement

Want to prototype a drawing environment in vr for the web.

Unable to commit much resources.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use a fork of Godot 3.4 for WebXR that includes delauney tetrahedralization processing.

**Postponed until Godot Engine master has WebXR**

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Extract geometry class from Godot Engine 4.0 to 3.4.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Stable

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Slower than Godot Engine master

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Godot master as of 2021-11-05
- Rejection Reason: Godot Master doesn't have WebXR on this date.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a project proposal.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I found an approach to do it.
