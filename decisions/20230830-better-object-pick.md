## Introduction

V-Sekai is a virtual reality (VR) platform that offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This documentation aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.

## The Challenge

V-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. To overcome these challenges and enhance the user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.

### Proposed Solutions

**Improving Object Pickup and Menus**: Enhancing object pickup mechanics and menus can make interactions within V-Sekai more intuitive and user-friendly. This may include refining controls, feedback mechanisms for object pickup, and finding alternative methods to access menus while in VR mode.

## The Strategy

To ensure efficient use of time and resources, it is advisable to choose one area to focus on and strive to complete it within a two-week timeframe. This focused approach allows for significant progress in improving V-Sekai.

## Upsides

By addressing these limitations, V-Sekai can offer a more seamless and immersive VR experience. Improving object pickup and menus will enhance user interactions, making them more intuitive and user-friendly. This will ultimately result in a more engaging and enjoyable experience for V-Sekai users.

## Downsides

Given the limited timeframe, it may not be possible to address all the identified limitations simultaneously. Additionally, the complexity of refining object pickup mechanics and menus may present challenges in achieving substantial improvements within the two-week timeframe. It's important to carefully assess the scope and feasibility of the proposed enhancements before committing to the timeframe.

## The Road Not Taken

While focusing on improving object pickup and menus is recommended for the given timeframe, it's important to acknowledge that there are other potential areas for improvement. Exploring options such as expanding the variety of worlds, integrating backend services, or optimizing performance can be considered in future iterations of V-Sekai.

## In Core and Done by Us?

The development team at V-Sekai should primarily handle the implementation and integration of the chosen improvement. However, collaborative efforts involving developers, designers, and user experience experts may be necessary to ensure the improvements align with the overall vision and goals of V-Sekai.
