Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node).\nNote: Interaction between nodes *within* a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\n\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\n\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all.\nAlso, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System's interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G.\nBy building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n**Todo**: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\n\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n### A. Spawning\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection.\nPlayers and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n### B. Consistent References\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID.\n**Todo**: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n### C. State Synchronization\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced.\nThe network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting.\nEvents can be used to provide forced updates.\nGuarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\n\n**Entity properties:**\n\n- State that is synced is properties.\n- Some properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\n- Some properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:  \n\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization: \n\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:  \n\nWhen to use reliable events vs. \"unreliable\" (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n### D. Standard Interaction Protocols\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist?\nExamples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n### E. Network Security Model:\n\n**Concepts:**\n\n**Ownership:**\n\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.  \nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\n\n**Mastership:**\n\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.  \n\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.  \n\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)  \nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player \"takes\" their props with them.)\n\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?  \n\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.  \n\nExample: Team Melee\n\n### F. Inter-entity Isolation\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.  \nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n### G. Abstraction\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity's functions.\n\n### H. Physics\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be *attached* to the entity in specific ways.  \nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n### Spawn Type (i). Map builtins\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.  \nFor example, a button/door; or a state \"god object\"; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n### Spawn Type (ii). Map spawns\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.  \nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.  \nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n### Spawn Type (iii). Avatar spawns\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.  \nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n### Notes about Entity parenting:\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed.\nParenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\n\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (`queue_free()`) or removed from the scene tree (`remove_child()`); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n## Positive Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n\n* Possibility of:\n  * vehicle games\n  * bow and arrow games\n  * pickup of balls\n\n## Negative Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n  \n* Complexity\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\nAldridge, David. \"I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach\".

Add every server to the \"`developement`\" environment. Also, assign linux servers to \"`mingw`\" and \"`linux`\". Assign the dind agents to \"`dind`\".\n\n\nFor GitLab, go to https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/go/admin/security/auth_configs and select `Create new authorization configuration` -> `gitlab-auth-config` / `GitLab Authentication plugin` / follow documentation here: https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gitlab-oauth-authorization-plugin/blob/master/INSTALL.md - **Do not check Allow only known users to login yet**. If this works, you can skip the text auth step and corresponding passwd commands.\n\nCreate Guest login:\n1. Go to auth_configs, `Create new authorization configuration` -> `guest-login` / `Guest Login Plugin` / Fill out Go server URL / Username `view` / Display name `Guest`.\n2. Now, go to Roles Management. Create role `guest`. Add Deny for all types and Resources `*` as desired.\n3. In an Incognito window, visit the CI system and login as Guest. Close the incognito window.\n4. Now, go to Users Management. Select view / Guest and select Roles -> `guest`\n5. Admin -> Pipelines. Select Pipeline Group `beta`, click + on the top right of the whole *group*, go to Roles, add `guest`, and only check **View**. Save this.\n\nAt this point, Guest should have permission to view pipelines, see logs, download artifacts but nothing else.\n\nFor text auth, go to https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/go/admin/security/auth_configs and select `Create new authorization configuration` -> `file-auth-config` / `Password File Authentication plugin` / `/godata/config/password.properties`\n\n```bash\nsudo kubectl exec gocd-server-6d77846995-5l244 -- touch /godata/config/password.properties\nsudo yum install httpd-tools\nhtpasswd -c -B passwd admin\ncat passwd | sudo kubectl exec gocd-server-6d77846995-5l244 -- sudo tee /kubepvc/pvc/*/godata/config/password.properties\n```\n\nNow go to users page, edit your user and enable `Global Admin`.\n\nNow go to file-auth-config, edit configuration, enable Allow only known users to login\n\n### gocd config repositories:\n\nGo to *ADMIN -> Config Repositories*\n- **Config repository Name:** groups-gocd-pipelines\n- **Plugin ID:** JSON Configuration Plugin\n- **Material Type:** Git\n- **URL:** git@gitlab.com:godot-groups/groups-gocd-pipelines\n- **Branch:** master\n- **GoCD pipeline files pattern:** *.gopipeline.json\n- **GoCD environment files pattern:** *.goenvironment.json\nRULES\n- **Allow:** Pipeline Group: beta\n- **Allow:** Environment: development\n\n### Setup of flux GitOps:\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/releases/download/1.20.2/fluxctl_linux_amd64\nsudo cp fluxctl_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/fluxctl\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fluxctl\nsudo helm repo add fluxcd https://charts.fluxcd.io\nsudo kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/helm-operator/master/deploy/crds.yaml\nsudo kubectl create namespace flux\nsudo kubectl identity --k8s-fwd-ns flux\n```\nFork the flux-config repository from here https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config into your own github account, and set GHUSER=your github account.\n\nNow, in your fork of flux-config, go to project Settings -> Deploy Keys and add the result of the above identity command. Make sure to check **Allow write access**.\n\nOnce you have done this, you can continue with the flux setup using your newly forked repository.\n\n```bash\nexport GHUSER=\"xxxxxxxxx\"\nsudo fluxctl install --git-user=${GHUSER} --git-email=${GHUSER}@users.noreply.github.com - -git-url=git@github.com:${GHUSER}/flux-config --git-path=workloads --namespace=flux > fluxcmd_install.yaml\nsudo kubectl apply -f fluxcmd_install.yaml\nsudo fluxctl --k8s-fwd-ns flux\nsudo fluxctl list-workloads --k8s-fwd-ns flux\n```\n\n\nFOR DEBUGGING ONLY: `sudo setenforce permissive` - this appears to have no effect, so there is a different problem.\n\n### Setting up cockroachdb:\n\n#### cockroachdb.values.yaml\n```yaml\nstatefulset:\n  resources:\n    limits:\n      memory: \"8Gi\"\n    requests:\n      memory: \"8Gi\"\nconf:\n  cache: \"2Gi\"\n  max-sql-memory: \"2Gi\"\ntls:\n  enabled: true\n```\n#### CockroachDB install\n\n```bash\nsudo helm install cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml cockroachdb/cockroachdb\nsudo kubectl certificate approve default.node.cockroachdb-0\nsudo kubectl certificate approve default.node.cockroachdb-1\nsudo kubectl certificate approve default.node.cockroachdb-2\nsudo kubectl certificate approve default.client.root\n\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl apply -f client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\n```\n\nIn SQL, write:\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE uro_prod;\nCREATE USER 'uro-prod' WITH PASSWORD 'blablablablaSOMEDATABASEPASSWORD';\nGRANT ALL ON DATABASE uro_prod to \"uro-prod\";\n```\n\nTo make backups:\n\n```bash\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach dump --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public uro_prod > uro_prod_backup.txt\n```\n\nApply secrets:\n```bash\n(On dev machine) MIX_ENV=prod mix phx.gen.secret\n# Copy the output of above, and copy the database password from above:\nsudo kubectl create secret generic uro-prod --from-literal=secret-key-base='GENERATED_WITH_ABOVE_COMMAND' --from-literal=pass='blablablablaSOMEDATABASEPASSWORD'\n\nsudo kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Sekai/uro/master/kubernetes.yaml\n```\n\n### Keeping the system and cluster up-to-date\n\n#### Upgrading fedora\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\n```bash\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\n```\n\nAnswer `y` to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any.

Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\n```\n\nComplete the upgrade with:\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\n```\n\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n#### Upgrading nginx and cert-manager\n\n```bash\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n```\n\n#### Upgrading k3s\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n```\n\n#### Upgrading cockroachdb\nRun the shell:\n```bash\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\n```\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, `20.2`\n\n    #\n    # Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n    # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n    # To exit, type: \\q.\n    #\n    # Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n\nReplace `some.version` in the following command with the value we found above:\n```sql\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\n```\n\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\n```bash\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml\n```\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Knowledge gains about service creation\n- Operation experience\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Constant maintenance\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n* Option: Dedicated Servers\n* Option: Virtual Machines\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nYes, it is possible to deploy this system using docker or in the root system.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nHaving experience with kubernetes and maintaining discipline will make scaling or service upgrades smoother in the future.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://k3s.io/\n"}]]}
