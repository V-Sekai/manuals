### Context and Problem Statement

People want to use V-Sekai, we need to provide coverage of their electronic equipment.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Cover 80% to 95% percent of the userbase's equipment, so people can play V-Sekai.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Provide coverage of:

1. Desktop mode
1. Meta Quest 2
1. Valve Index
1. HTC Vive

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
