## Context

During GDC 2018, Yoko Taro and Takahisa Taura, key figures behind the creation of 'NieR:Automata', shared their insights on game development. Their panel was among the most attended, shedding light on the philosophy of game development and the intricacies of crafting an immersive world.

## Problem

The primary challenge in game development lies in striking a balance between open-world freedom and rich content. While gamers often equate ultimate freedom with open-world games, many such titles lack depth. The goal should be to design the right gameplay mechanics while ensuring high player immersion.

## Strategy

> "Freedom is in a future that you did not have in the past" - Yoko Taro (40:40)

Yoko Taro emphasized the importance of incorporating freedom in a game while maintaining a balance between an open-world and rich content. He drew inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when building the world of NieR. This strategy involves creating easy-to-learn gameplay without hindering the flow of the experience.

## Pros

This approach fosters a more immersive gaming experience. By concentrating on the appropriate gameplay mechanics and balancing open-world freedom with rich content, developers can produce games that are both engaging and meaningful.

## Cons

The downside to this approach is that it may necessitate more time and resources for development. Achieving a balance between open-world freedom and rich content can be a complex task, demanding meticulous planning and execution.

## Alternative Approach

An alternative strategy could involve focusing exclusively on either open-world freedom or rich content. However, this could lead to a game that lacks depth or fails to fully captivate players.

## Limited Use Case

This approach may not be suitable for all types of games. For instance, games that are heavily story-driven may not benefit from an open-world format.

## Alignment with Our Core Philosophy?

This strategy is in line with our core philosophy of game development. We believe in crafting immersive experiences that balance freedom with rich content.
