## Context and Problem Statement

Godot Engine lacks an asset store service.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Write an elixir service that stores data in a database.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use elixir.

Use ecto with sqlite.

- [x] Upgrade elixir-sqlite/exqlite to 3.37.0
- [ ] Upgrade elixir-sqlite/ecto_sqlite3 to support strict mode.
- [ ] Punt using elixir-sqlite/ecto_sqlite3

Use ecto with cockroachdb.

- [ ] Make distribution of OSS cockroachdb for windows.

Convert godot asset store api to an openapi schema.

- [ ] <https://mermade.github.io/openapi-gui/>

Provide a phoenix web server.

Works on Windows.

Design a sqlite dataabase schema.

Investigate membrane framework.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to publish v-sekai addons.
- Overlay existing asset library
- Able to in a future feature post process packed scenes exported by V-Selai

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Use the existing asset library backend
- Rejection Reason: Does not use a modern tech stack.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Don't need a line of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a V-Sekai service and I know of an approach.
