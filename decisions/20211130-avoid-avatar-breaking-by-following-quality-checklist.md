## Context and Problem Statement

Avoid avatar breaking which harmful to the person using the avatar.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create a checklist to ensure quality.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

This is defined for a VRM character.

- Add a root bone
- Age height normalization to 1.59m for an Asian adult female.
- Auto generate spring bones via <https://fujisunflower.booth.pm/items/2087178>
- Check eyes
- Check Jaws
- Adjust spring bones limits
- Check transparent glasses etc.
- Run mesh mush at 80 degrees twist on all vertices
- Check culling locations
- Match shade and base color in MTOON1
- The relative angle between the Hips and the Thigh should something that works for inverse kinematics.
- Check manifolds for skin breaking

Move the feet to the origin of the scene

- Cursor to world origin
- Change to origin
- Move to below feet
- Move object origin to origin

Check if environment lighting breaks the avatar

- Change sky temperature to the brightest
- test 0.00001 light intensity
- test 16 light intensity

How to make a Portrait of the head photo?

- E96E66 background color
- 16 light intensity and camera set to realistic focal length for a portrait makes the photo look good.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Less avatar breaking.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Work

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Do nothing.
- Rejection Reason: This is unacceptable to the people who use the avatars.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This can be automated in the future.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a guideline and we are in the area.
