### Added

- Work in progress with humanoid muscle encoding to/from quaternion. We can use this in the future for more efficient network serialization (similar to ShaderMotion's format, or networked IK)
- Some progress on CDN code to make it a bit more reliable and engineered. It supports both gltf and godot scene format.
- fire and fwsGonzo have been working hard on godot-sandbox, a scripting system which allows you to write C++ code which acts like GDScript, via a sandboxed risc-v VM
- In terms of engine features, typed dictionaries are in! <https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/> That said, code which uses typed dictionaries will be incompatible with Godot 4.3 and earlier.
