## Context and Problem Statement

CICD builds take too long to do.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Try to aim for 10 minute builds and reduce stress.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Try to aim for the godot cicd builds to finish in 10 minute.

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

We can see the results of our work.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Might need to do special tricks.

## Option graveyard:

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a dev ops change.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the github repositories.
