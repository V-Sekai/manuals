## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai is a VR virtual world platform.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Build V-Sekai.

- Spatialized audio and VOIP support
- A custom networking stack
- A security-focused sandboxed scripting environment backed by WASM
- Customizable servers with their own individual game rules
- Dependable for important presentations

As a 3d world builder, I want to upload a world to invite my friends to experience (Voice Communication, Reliability, Networked) with me.

1. Uninstalled: give a URL with a copy of the game.
2. Installed: url to uro that sends an url
   1. v-sekai://v-sekai.org/lyuma/home?key=asjdfhgdtg#68.4,1.4,0.34
   1. Register windows protocol handler

As an explorer, I want to browse a selection of places to visit.

As a user, I want to pick up objects to hand them to my friend.

As a user, I want to bring my identity (my avatar) to interact with in V-Sekai.

As a developer, I need V-Sekai to understand my needs to have an excellent developer-user experience.

As a creative, I want to edit my V-Sekai virtual environment to better suit my requirements and preferences.

As a user developer, I want to remix V-Sekai to better suit my requirements and preferences.

As a person, I want to work with a group that shares my values.

As a person, I want to survive long enough to build V-Sekai.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Register protocol.

```
def register_protocol(proto, command):
    import winreg
    key = winreg.CreateKey(winreg.HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, rf"{proto}")
    winreg.SetValueEx(key, "", 0, winreg.REG_SZ, f"URL:{proto} protocol")
    winreg.SetValueEx(key, "URL Protocol", 0, winreg.REG_SZ, "")
    key = winreg.CreateKey(winreg.HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, rf"{proto}\shell\open\command")
    winreg.SetValueEx(key, "", 0, winreg.REG_SZ, command)
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- It matters that we are here to create V-Sekai. I imagine a future where all the virtual world platforms are closed, with no space to create and remix.
- We are making V-Sekai to serve people who want to create and be in the metaverse.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- We are promoting Native VRM support so arbitrary 3d models aren't on the golden path as of 2021-12-16.
- We choose native code on the devices, so we can't use the interoperability of the web as of 2021-12-16.
- We choose Godot Engine which is an open source game engine to own our dependencies, so it is hard to use off the shelf commercial technologies.
- We prefer de-facto or open standards for the most reach, so we may not be able to get the exact solution we want without effort.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Use dominant VR platforms.
- Rejection Reason: At this moment. there is an opportunity to have a coalition of open metaverse.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

V-Sekai needs a strategy and not code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are V-Sekai and only we can be who we want to be.

### Minimum Requirements to not Fail Right Away

> You should consider the following as mere table stakes:
> High-quality multiplayer support for user #creation out of the box
> High-performance servers with excellent reliability
> Powerful, user-friendly, and joyful creation tools
