## Context and Problem Statement

Meetings need to be ran better than randomly.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Lean coffee can improve on meetings.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Three column kanban board. To discuss, discussing, and discussed.

Have everyone add cards for topics they want to discuss. It may take 2-3 min for people to get into the Trello board. Once in take 2-3 min to add topics to the left column.

Then have everyone vote, each person gets 2-3 votes. To vote, they should click the card of a topic to discuss and in the comments type "+". Be sure nobody else adds any other comments until we begin discussing the cards.

Last, sort the cards by number of comments (most amount of + go to top) and then one by one drag in the top card to "discussing". Set a timer for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes the group votes to keep discussing or to move on. While discussing the group can add comments or links to the card while discussing.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Organized meetings are better

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Can be strange to use because it's not common.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Gather for one hour randomly.
- Rejection Reason: We can do better.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need to run better meetings.
