## The Backdrop

Constantly changing blender versions is a problem for blender import

## The Challenge

We want to pin the blender version.

## The Strategy

Pin the blender version to the steam version of LTS Blender -- Blender (3.6)

## The Upside

We get the fast upgrades of steam and the pinning requirement satisfied.

## The Downside

Dependent on steam.

## The Road Not Taken

Download a version of Blender directly.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Ask someone to use blender for you.

## In Core and Done by Us?

This is a staff note.
