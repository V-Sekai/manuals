## Problem

V-Sekai has a problem with its bone hierarchy conversion. This causes issues with Alicia's hips-spine angle.

## Solution

We suggest a new conversion method. It keeps the original bone hierarchy and translates bone names from Japanese to English. This avoids problems caused by changing the hierarchy.

## Changes

1. Original hierarchy (Japanese names):

   ```
   Center (センター)
   ├ UpperBody (上半身)
   └ LowerBody (下半身)
   ```

2. New method, same hierarchy, translated names:

   ```
   Center (Hips)
   ├ UpperBody (Spine)
   └ LowerBody (Legs)
   ```

3. After the second conversion, the hierarchy changes:
   ```
   Hips (LowerBody)
   └ Spine (UpperBody)
   ```

This solution keeps the right hips-spine angle for Alicia.

## Good Outcomes

- Keeps the original bone hierarchy, avoiding animation issues.
- Translates bone names to English, helping non-Japanese speakers.

## Bad Outcomes

- Might need more time to create the new method.

## Other Options

- Changing the hierarchy during conversion caused the problem.

## Can it be fixed with a script?

No, this needs a new method in the bone hierarchy conversion process.

## Should we do it?

Yes, it affects character animations and user experience with V-Sekai models.
