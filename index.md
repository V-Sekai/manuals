# V-Sekai Social VR

We're creating an open-source virtual reality platform that prioritizes ease of use and meets the requirements of the VR community. Become a part of the [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org) team by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7BQDHesck8)! 

`vī-sekai` translates to "V-World" in English.
