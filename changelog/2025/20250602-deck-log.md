- **Activities:**
  - Discussion about uploading a prop (beachball.tscn) to staging/default server:
    - dragonhunt02 requested upload of `vsk_default/scenes/prefabs/beachball.tscn`.
    - iFire inquired about whitelisting and upload process.
    - dragonhunt02 provided `curl` commands for login and file upload, mentioning editor doesn't support prop upload yet.
    - iFire mentioned username/token authentication and current work on a mesh capsule fitter.
    - dragonhunt02 decided to test with a local server and is reviewing V-Sekai game addons.
  - Discussion about Godot Whisper addon (CaptureStreamToText node):
    - Silver (30/05/2025) reported an issue with stopping/resetting transcription and later an "audio_ctx is larger than the maximum allowed" error.
    - iFire (30/05/2025) suggested restarting the node as a workaround for the reset issue.
    - Silver (Yesterday) found a workaround for resetting by wiping the text label and variable. For the audio_ctx error, they hardcoded the value to 1500.
    - iFire (Yesterday) expressed interest in switching to ONNX for Whisper to potentially improve stability and add features like a denoiser, referencing [Godot-ONNX-AI-Models-Loaders](https://github.com/mat490/Godot-ONNX-AI-Models-Loaders) and [Audio-Denoiser-ONNX](https://github.com/DakeQQ/Audio-Denoiser-ONNX).
