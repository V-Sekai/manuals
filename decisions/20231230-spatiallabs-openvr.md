# Deprecated: Valid configuration of Spatiallabs and Openxr

## Metadata

- **Status:** Deprecated
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai
- **Tags:** V-Sekai, fixed

## The Backdrop

This proposal aims to define a valid configuration of OpenVR and SpatialLabs display.

## The Challenge

The main challenge is to display Unity applications like SteamVR home and others.

## The Strategy

To overcome the challenge, use these exact versions:

1. `SpatialLabs EC PRO_Acer_1.2.288_Win11x64`
2. `Acer SteamVR Bridge.Installer.1.00.1001`

## The Upside

By using these specific versions, we can avoid the latest update that causes the screen to be black. This ensures a seamless experience for users.

## The Downside

The downside of this approach is that we are losing out on the latest updates and improvements that come with them.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to use a different product like the Looking Glass Factory, but they don't support openxr.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Another infrequent use case could be only flat desktop.

## In Core and Done by Us?

I have access to equipment and it's not easy to get access. This means that the implementation and testing of this proposal will be done by us.
