# Proposed: The Wandering Bakery - Prototype

## What is the context of the proposal?

A simplified game environment testing LLM-driven dynamic storytelling within a traveling bakery setting.

## What is the problem being solved?

Static game stories limit player agency. An LLM can generate responsive narratives that adapt to player choices.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams.

Players visit procedurally generated villages, converse with LLM-created characters, bake thematic pastries, and influence narrative outcomes. GTPyhop-style planning tracks goals like “satisfy_character” and provides operators (bake_pastry, give_pastry, talk_to) to drive emergent gameplay.

## What are the benefits of the proposal?

Enables dynamic storytelling, rapid LLM-driven iteration, and emergent gameplay guided by structured planning.

## What are the downsides of the proposal?

Limited scope and potential unpredictability in LLM outputs.

## What are the alternative proposals?

A more complex full-featured game, but that is not feasible initially.

## When might the proposed solution be used rarely or not at all?

If no LLM-driven narrative features are needed or if static stories are preferred.

## Is this a V-Sekai core responsibility, and can it be done by us?

Yes, it aligns with V-Sekai’s focus on innovative game development and LLM experiments.

## What is the status of the proposal?

Status: Proposed

## Who is making decisions on the proposal?
