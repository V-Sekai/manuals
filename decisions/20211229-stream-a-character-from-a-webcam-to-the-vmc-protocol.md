## Context and Problem Statement

Stream a character from a webcam to the vmc protocol so it can be played in any VMC receiver.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Kalidokit packages mediapipe, opengl acceleration and tensorflow.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use kalidokit and have it output the vmc protocol using osc.js.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Output OSC.js which Godot Engine can use.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Uses the nodejs runtimes which is added complexity.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I joined the dots.
