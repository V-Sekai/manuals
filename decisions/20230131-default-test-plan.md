## Context and Problem Statement

Want to write down the default test plan for V-sekai on engine upgrades.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Write the default test plans.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Check if OpenXR godot works by joining a server.
1. On pancake desktop mode, check if two clients connect to a 1 server and see each other's movements.
1. Check if you can export a map.
1. WIP Check audio io

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

These are the default things that should work.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Work.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a standard procedure.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need to test our work.
