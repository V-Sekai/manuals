## Context and Problem Statement

I want to be able to download the godot vrm addon from the asset library in 4.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

By publishing we will have reviewed the bugs and decide it is ready to be use.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Submit godot vrm to the godot 4 asset library lyuma

Started because of discussion with <https://twitter.com/AlfredBaudisch/status/1586999148171198465?s=20&t=nUHLXskgrxnTbPFN9WzZxQ> about mtoon outlines

## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->

We'll prepare for release.

## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->

Old bugs might not be fixed.

## Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Godot VRM is a few gdscripts.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Godot VRM is a core feature.
