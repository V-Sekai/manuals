# Accepted: Degrade V-Sekai's networking model to work in 2d and with webrtc

- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,

## Context and Problem Statement

Make V-Sekai Godot work in 2D and on the web.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Degrade the V-Sekai networking model.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

- The networking system exclusively uses the MultiplayerAPI, which by default is implemented via ENet, so one would have to swap that part with the WebRTC equivalent. Convert the ENet module to use WebRTC

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Works in Opengl Godot 4
- Works on the web with webrtc
- Can disable 3D for size.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of gdscript.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is core.

## References <!-- optional -->
