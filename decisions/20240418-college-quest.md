# Draft: Town Courier

## The Context

In the current gaming landscape, there is a noticeable gap for immersive, open-world games set in realistic environments such as a college town. Most games focus on fantasy or post-apocalyptic settings, leaving room for games that engagingly simulate everyday life.

## The Problem Statement

The goal is to create an open-world game that provides players with a unique and dynamic environment, offering a fresh experience every time they play. The game should be set in a bustling college town and allow players to take on the role of a delivery person completing quests. The delivery person will navigate the town on a moped, adding an extra layer of fun and challenge to the gameplay.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

"Town Courier" will be developed using the Godot Engine. The game world will be procedurally generated, ensuring that no two playthroughs are identical. NPCs will assign delivery quests to the player, who must navigate the town and deliver items on a moped within a specified time limit. We will utilize the preexisting vehicle code from "Crappy Contraptions" to facilitate the movement mechanics in our game.

## The Benefits

This game will fill a niche in the market for realistic, open-world games. It will provide players with a unique and dynamic gaming experience, keeping them engaged and encouraging replayability.

## The Downsides

The development of a procedurally generated open-world game can be complex and time-consuming. Additionally, balancing the difficulty of the quests to ensure they are challenging but not frustrating may require extensive testing and tweaking.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to create a static game world with pre-defined quests. However, this would not provide the same level of replayability and could become repetitive for players.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In rare cases, the procedural generation may create a game world that is difficult or impossible to navigate. This will need to be addressed during testing.

## In Core and Done by Us

The core gameplay mechanics, including movement, item pickup, and quest assignment, will be developed by our team. We will also handle the creation of the procedurally generated game world.
