- 2021-10-04 08:18:08Z	lyuma:	I believe this proposal is sort of a generalization of the retargeting system you might find in Unity, without going into specifics on the implementation of the retargeting: what Reduz calls a "Retargeter" is what you would call an "Avatar" in Unity.

Next up is parsing the texture filename mapping from FBX files to assist in material discovery, since Unity legacy materials default to lookup by texture *filename* rather than material name or texture name. Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won't quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest. Will probably revisit this decision later."		👍 (4)

Want to create some example projects for this. It's also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it's running OBSCENELY slow at the moment.		🦥 (1)

- 2021-05-24 18:08:49Z	Saracen:	From my end, big progress made on the asset validation layer. It of course needs proper robust testing (we'll organize something to try and break the security), but I consider it mostly done. Some remaining issues: ensuring mesh and colliders are not on reserved layers, exposing more things as value tracks, exposing more canvas UI elements, better error reporting, checking for cyclic node dependencies, checking entity 'model' scenes, properly embedding 3D canvas data on exporter, properly embedding model resources, enabling checks only for web scenes.		👍 (1)

- 2021-05-21 22:51:16Z	lyuma:	"I worked with fire on debugging glTF. I think we're going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.
    1. Radical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.
    2. Add BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.
    3. While in `_determine_skeletons`, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the `_determine_skeletons` code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.

    Bugs:
    1. Animations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects
    2. We ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.
    3. MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints? The glb here should have a spinning diamond and two spinning skinned cubes:"	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845433592888557568/MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3.glb

- 2021-04-30 06:47:12Z	fire: 	Lyuma — MaterialX in glTF would allow for a generalization of "KHR_materials_variants" extension - in other words, MaterialX would allow for character or object customization to textures baked at load time		
- 2021-04-30 06:06:58Z	fire: 	Made a proposal for GLTF2 to include MaterialX in three stages. A stage 0 extension where it replaces png and a stage 1 extension that replaces gltf variants for parameters, stage 2 would be adding arbitrary graphs as parameters.

**Postponed Discussion**: Modular audio system (like JACK) godot#35613
**Interest**: Integrate interactive music PR godot#32769
**Interest**: Discuss audio stream graph
**Approved**: Onboarding for newcomers to the audio side of Godot development
**Interest**: Godot Audio Graph:
   - better reuse of mixing/effect chains
   - better interaction with areas 2d/3d (currently we have just Areas linked to a bus)

- 2021-04-28 01:35:29Z	lyuma:	The current architecture only allows 100% weight paint to a single bone at a time, and this can cause a seam to appear on softbody meshes		
- 2021-04-28 01:34:43Z	lyuma:	While usability is nice to have, my interest is specifically in revising the underlying architecture of Softbody weight painting as the current storage format is resource intensive and not sufficiently flexible for my needs.

- 2021-04-28 01:06:56Z	fire: 	**Other Pouley topics**: Godot physics has a recent pr for multithreaded physics. After Godot Physics having the same set of features, he's going to work on fixing bugs. Pouley will be around as a paid contributor for the next period of time.		
- 2021-04-28 01:04:50Z	fire: 	**Pouley Topics**: need to help Twigleg do 2d IK as a prerequisite to 3d IK (3d Skeleton Modification stack). Talked about vertex painting in godot and トカゲ's bone subgizmos needing coordination with Reduz and JFons. Talked about gltf2 having quads but too difficult to get into both blender, godot and gltf. This came up because I and Pouley worked on subdivision surfaces and how they break for uv mapped triangular meshes on the seams.
