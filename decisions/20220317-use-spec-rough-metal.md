### Describe the tags of the issue

V-Sekai,

### Context and Problem Statement

We want to be able to use Specular from gltf and Specular from spec gloss, but previous solutions did not compose with the principled pbr roughness metallness model.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Implement specular from gltf.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

???

### Positive Consequences

We can import spec gloss for compatibility.

Demos show multicolored transparency.

### Negative Consequences

- More complexity

### Option graveyard

- Option: Add spec gloss extension
- Does not compose with roughness metalness.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Changing the standard material 3d is a core decision.
