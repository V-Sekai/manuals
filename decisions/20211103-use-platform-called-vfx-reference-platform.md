## Context and Problem Statement

> [A standard reference platform's purpose is to] minimize incompatibilities between different software packages, ease the support burden for Linux-based pipelines and encourage further adoption of Linux by software vendors.

Here are some problems:

- We want to keep a consistent server configuration setup.
- We want creators to have a consistent work environment.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

> The VFX Reference #platform is a set of tool and library versions to be used as a common target #platform for building software for the VFX industry. Its purpose is to minimize incompatibilities between different software packages, ease the support burden for Linux-based pipelines and encourage further adoption of Linux by software vendors. The Reference #platform is updated annually by a group of software vendors in collaboration with the Visual Effects Society Technology Committee.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Find candidate centos-like platforms.
1. A candidate is Rocky Linux.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- The problems with #platform are informed by decisions of others in the industry.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Going outside the #platform is risky.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Use Rocky Linux directly
- Rejection Reason: No collaboration

- Option: Use Fedora 35 directly
- Rejection Reason: Unclear support lifetime.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a devops proposal, not a coding proposal.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We do have to choose a reference #platform even if we don't think about it to upload to docker.
