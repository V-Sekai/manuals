## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai faces limitations in providing a seamless cross-platform experience for VR Social players. How can we improve compatibility and user experience across various platforms?

## Proposed Solution

Distribute artwork in Blend, VRM, and Unity Asset Package formats to ensure easy portability and compatibility with multiple platforms, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Implementation

1. Create and export artwork in Blend, VRM, and Unity Asset Package formats.
1. Utilize appropriate formats for each platform, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.

## Positive Consequences

- Improved compatibility across various platforms.
- Enhanced user experience for VR Social players.
- Increased adoption of V-Sekai due to better cross-platform support.

## Negative Consequences

- Additional development time and resources required to create and maintain multiple asset formats.
- Potential performance issues on lower-end devices.

## Option graveyard

- Creating separate assets and configurations for each platform, increasing development time and maintenance complexity.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This enhancement aims to improve the core experience for users across various platforms and cannot be achieved with a simple workaround.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Providing a seamless cross-platform experience is essential for V-Sekai's success. Implementing this feature in-house ensures full control over its development and tailoring to specific needs.
