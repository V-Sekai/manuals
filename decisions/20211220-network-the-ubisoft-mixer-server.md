## Context and Problem Statement

We want to use the Ubisoft Mixer project more easily.

The Ubisoft mixer project is also a good way to share Godot Engine scenes.

The problem is the mixer project is in Python and doesn't have file sync.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

My proposed solution is to write a elixir server that syncs the Blender file and the file share.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Extract Mixer broadcaster code
2. Write an Elixir udp based broadcaster with webrtc
3. Write an Elixir file sync (SECURITY WARNING)

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Easier to host mixer.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- The software may be a vector for security attacks.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Use V-Sekai as a networking sync.
- Rejection Reason: Not ready yet and someone is working on it.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how to do this and no one else is doing it.
