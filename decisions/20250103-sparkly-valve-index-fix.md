# Proposed: Sparkly Valve Index Display Fix

## What is the context of the proposal?

The Steam Valve Index is still a reliable and robust head-mounted display for virtual reality. We should try to use it for as long as possible.

## What is the problem being solved?

A few weeks back, I started to get white and blue sparkling pixels on dark scenes.

[PSA: If you have sparkling pixels recently, there is a fix!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/oxd6xa/psa_if_you_have_sparkling_pixels_recently_there/)

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams.

Enable DisplayPort training mode - compatibility mode A or B (B worked for me).

## What are the benefits of the proposal?

The display sparkles are gone.

## What are the downsides of the proposal?

A few moments of testing time with SteamVR.

## What are the alternative proposals?

Alternative compatibility modes were considered but ultimately not pursued. We also did not replace the display cable.

## When might the proposed solution be used rarely or not at all?

This fix addresses users experiencing sparkling pixels on dark scenes.

## Is this a V-Sekai core responsibility, and can it be done by us?

This is not a V-Sekai core responsibility. Fire implemented the DisplayPort training mode adjustment and found it helpful.
