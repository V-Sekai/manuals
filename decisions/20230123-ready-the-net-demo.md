# Draft: Ready net demo

### Context and Problem Statement

Get the net demo ready for merge into V-Sekai

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to get the net demo ready for presentation.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. jitter buffer window of 100ms
2. bit packing with the godot engine core animation compression
3. perfect prediction using ballistic trajectory <https://github.com/fbsamples/oculus-networked-physics-sample/blob/f4242f317fc1c81348308bdd69774c637c3c0f91/Networked%20Physics/Assets/Scripts/Prediction.cs#L48>

### Positive Consequences

We'll have lag free VR network sync.

### Negative Consequences

May have cheating with this type of replication.

### Option graveyard

Option: The status quo.
Rejection Reason: This solves nothing.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are doing this.
