## Context and Problem Statement

Not all the branches are released and are currently named godot4. They should be renamed to main.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Rename all godot4 branches to be main for v-sekai-game.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

need some consensus. I think that given v-sekai-game has only one branch it should be named

Lyuma — Today at 16:11

I agree provided we do the same with the submodules

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- cohersion

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- change

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Do nothing.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Code organization.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the repos.
