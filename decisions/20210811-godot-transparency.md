# Accepted: OIT in Godot Engine

### Context and Problem Statement

Render hair well.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use "Shortcut" or "PPLL" to render OIT transparency.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

> Shortcut takes 4 passes but is faster.

TressFX technology uses order independent transparency.

> (OIT). There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass
> method referred to as Shortcut.

> The main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can
> be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX
> 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in
> the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Avatars are a strength of V-Sekai.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

Code complexity.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Reduz isn't interested in OIT.
