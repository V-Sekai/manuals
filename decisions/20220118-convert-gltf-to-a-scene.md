## Context and Problem Statement

We want to import gltf audio emitters in Godot Engine.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We designed a gltf audio emitter extension with OMI.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Convert gltf to a scene with AudioStreamPlayer3D
2. convert AudiostreamPlayer3D to gltf
3. Publish to the Godot Engine 4.0 asset library

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Audio emitters.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Work needs to be done to implement omi audio.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: The current status.
- Rejection Reason: Unable to load audio from artwork.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I proposed the idea and people at OMI are starting to move on.
