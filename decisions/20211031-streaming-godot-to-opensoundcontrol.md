# Draft: Take a streaming godot game and streaming the VRM to OpenSoundControl

### Context and Problem Statement

Streaming to Godot OSC to jsons.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Stream the animation player because we have no way to stream Godot as a autonomous program.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

1. Take animation player
2. Put it in a animation tree
3. Animation node streams motions to osc
4. Take osc to node.js

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

It's rare to know how to dothis.
