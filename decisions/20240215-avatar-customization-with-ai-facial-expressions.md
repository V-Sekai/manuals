### Proposed: Enhancing Avatar Expressiveness with AI-Generated Blend Shapes

#### The Context

In the realm of virtual reality, expressiveness is paramount for a rich social experience. V-Sekai is dedicated to providing users with robust avatar customization options, particularly in the realm of facial expressions.

#### The Problem Statement

The current scope of facial expression customization in V-Sekai is limited. It lacks the depth necessary for users to craft avatars that can exhibit a comprehensive range of emotions, which detracts from the immersive experience and social interaction within the platform.

#### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

To be determined.

#### The Benefits

- **Enhanced realism** and emotional conveyance in avatars.
- **Greater diversity** in facial expressions enriches communication between users.
- Simplification of complex expression creation makes **avatar personalization accessible** to all skill levels.

#### The Downsides

- Potential **performance impact** due to real-time AI processing.
- The requirement for ongoing **dataset updates** to improve and maintain AI model accuracy.

#### The Road Not Taken

Alternative options included manual blend shape sculpting by artists and community-driven expression templates, both of which were deemed to lack scalability and flexibility compared to an AI-based solution.

#### The Infrequent Use Case

For users requiring highly specialized expressions seldom encountered in regular interactions, such as niche cultural facial gestures.

#### In Core and Done by Us

This initiative is core to V-Sekai's mission of enhanced user interaction and must be developed in-house to ensure deep integration and alignment with existing systems.
